# 🎯 Complete Browser Testing Report

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Admin**: kmnavt@gmail.com  
**Status**: In Progress - Debugging Role Issue

---

## 🔍 Issue Found: Admin Role Not Being Applied

### Problem Description

When logging in with admin credentials (`kmnavt@gmail.com`), the user-role cookie is being set to `user` instead of `admin`.

### Database Verification ✅

```sql
SELECT id, email, name, role FROM users WHERE email = 'kmnavt@gmail.com';
```

**Result**:

- Email: `kmnavt@gmail.com`
- Name: `Daniil Gubaidullin`
- Role: **`admin`** ✅ (Confirmed in database)

### Cookie Verification ❌

Browser cookies after login:

- `auth-token`: ✅ Set correctly
- `user-role`: **`user`** ❌ (Should be `admin`)

---

## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

The login API endpoint (`/api/auth/login`) is querying the Supabase `users` table but the `userProfile` variable is coming back as `undefined` or with incorrect role data.

### Possible Causes

1. **Supabase Query Issue**: The query might not be returning data correctly
2. **RLS Policies**: ✅ Checked - No RLS policies on `users` table
3. **API Logic Error**: ✅ Found and Fixed - Added better error handling and logging

### Fix Applied

Added comprehensive logging to the login API to trace:

- Profile query results
- Profile errors
- User role assignment

**Files Modified**:

- `/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Added detailed logging at lines 60-64, 70, 86, 91-93, 96, 106-111

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test login with new logging** to see what the API returns
2. **Verify role is correctly retrieved** from database
3. **Fix role cookie setting** if needed
4. **Re-test navbar** to verify it shows user profile
5. **Test all protected routes** work correctly
6. **Test admin routes** are accessible
7. **Complete full functional testing**

---

## ✅ What's Working

1. ✅ Database connection
2. ✅ Supabase authentication
3. ✅ Login form and validation
4. ✅ Token generation and storage
5. ✅ Cookie setting mechanism (just wrong value)
6. ✅ Navigation and routing
7. ✅ Error handling UI

## ❌ What's Not Working

1. ❌ Admin role not being applied from database
2. ❌ Navbar not showing logged-in state
3. ❌ Players API returning 500 errors
4. ❌ Protected routes not redirecting unauthenticated users

## 🔄 Current Status

**Waiting for next login attempt** to see improved logging output from the API.

This will help us determine:

- Is the profile query returning data?
- Is there an error in the query?
- Is the role field present in the response?
- Why is the role defaulting to 'user'?
