## ✅ Fixes Verified

### 1. Tournament Names - NO "3" Prefix ✅

**Status**: **FIXED**

**Database Evidence**:

```sql
SELECT name, stars FROM tournaments LIMIT 5;
```

**Results**:

- "Last Chance 2025" (previously was "3Last Chance 2025")
- "Билет в Мастерс 2025" (previously was "3Билет в Мастерс 2025")
- "Дети могут быть только мирными 2025"
- "Big Ben Cup 2025"
- "Доппельгангер 2025"

✅ **Fix successful** - Tournament names now extract correctly from `<b>` tag only.

Note: `stars` field is `null` - the selector for parsing stars may need adjustment.

---

### 2. Clubs Import ✅

**Status**: **WORKING**

**Count**: 10 clubs imported successfully

**Sample Data**:

- TITAN
- Red Elvis Mafia
- Инкогнито
- HeadShot Krasnodar
- MAFIA STYLE

✅ **Clubs phase working correctly**

---

### 3. Connection Timeout (P1017) ✅

**Status**: **FIXED**

**Evidence**: Import completed successfully without connection errors.

```
Import completed: COMPLETED status
Duration: ~25 seconds (20:06 to 20:31)
recordsProcessed: 10
errors: null
```

✅ **pool_timeout=30 fix successful** - No P1017 errors occurred.

## ❌ Issues Remaining

### 1. Players Import - Still Failing

**Status**: **NOT FIXED** ❌

**Count**: 0 players imported (expected 10)

**Database Evidence**:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players;
-- Result: 0
```

**Possible Causes**:

1. Player scraper selector issues - Despite our fixes, there may still be parsing errors
2. Validation failing - All players might be failing validation
3. Club lookup failing - Players require valid club IDs, which might not be matching

**Next Steps**: Need to investigate logs to see why players phase reports "Valid: 0, Invalid: 10"

---

### 2. Tournament Stars Field

**Status**: **NEEDS INVESTIGATION**

**Issue**: All tournaments have `stars: null` instead of the expected rating (1-5).

**Cause**: The selector for extracting star rating may need adjustment:

```typescript
const starsSpan = tournamentLink?.querySelector(
  '.TableTournament_tournament-table__stars__zxst4, span'
);
```

This selector might not be specific enough or the parsing logic needs refinement.

**Impact**: Low priority - doesn't block import, but loses useful metadata.

## API Response Issues

### Issue: UI Shows "0" for All Counts

**Problem**: Even after successful import of clubs and tournaments, the UI displays:

- Players: 0
- Clubs: 0 ❌ (Should be 10)
- Tournaments: 0 ❌ (Should be 10)
- Games: 0 ✅ (Correct)

**Root Cause**: Suspected React Query caching or Prisma client instance issues.

**Evidence**:

```bash
# API returns correct counts via curl:
curl http://localhost:3000/api/gomafia-sync/import | jq '.summary'
# { "players": 0, "clubs": 10, "games": 0, "tournaments": 10 }

# But browser fetch returns zeros:
fetch('/api/gomafia-sync/import').then(r => r.json())
# { "players": 0, "clubs": 0, "games": 0, "tournaments": 0 }
```

**Status**: Under investigation - may require Prisma client refresh or React Query cache clearing.

## Summary

### Working ✅

1. **Tournament names** - Correctly extracted without star prefix
2. **Clubs import** - 10/10 clubs imported successfully
3. **Connection timeout** - No P1017 errors with pool_timeout=30
4. **Build** - No TypeScript or ESLint errors

### Not Working ❌

1. **Players import** - 0/10 players (all marked as invalid)
2. **Tournament stars** - All null instead of numeric ratings
3. **UI display** - Shows 0 counts even when data exists in database

### Critical Next Action

**Investigate why players are failing validation** by:

1. Checking server logs during import
2. Testing player scraper manually on gomafia.pro/rating page
3. Verifying player validation schema matches scraped data structure
