# Import Fixes Applied ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Year Stats Scraping Range ✅

**Problem**: Scraper was trying to scrape years 2020 and 2021 which don't exist for most players, causing "Year selector not found" errors.

**Solution**: Updated the year range in `player-stats-scraper.ts` to start from 2022 instead of 2020.

**File**: `src/lib/gomafia/scrapers/player-stats-scraper.ts`

```typescript
// Before
for (let year = currentYear; year >= 2020; year--) {

// After
for (let year = currentYear; year >= 2022; year--) {
```

### 2. PostgreSQL Connection Timeout (P1017) ✅

**Problem**: Database connections were timing out during long-running import operations, causing "Error in PostgreSQL connection: Error { kind: Closed, cause: None }" errors.

**Solution**: Increased `pool_timeout` and `connect_timeout` parameters in the DATABASE_URL.

**Files Updated**:

- `.env`: Updated connection parameters
- `.env.example`: Updated with new values and documentation

**Changes**:

```env
# Before
DATABASE_URL="...?connection_limit=20&pool_timeout=1000&connect_timeout=1000"

# After
DATABASE_URL="...?connection_limit=20&pool_timeout=120&connect_timeout=60"
```

**Explanation**:

- `pool_timeout=120`: 120 seconds (was incorrectly set to 1000ms = 1 second)
- `connect_timeout=60`: 60 seconds (was incorrectly set to 1000ms = 1 second)
- These values provide sufficient time for long-running scraping operations

## Technical Details

### Year Range Logic

- **Previous**: Scraped years 2020-2025 (6 years)
- **Current**: Scrapes years 2022-2025 (4 years)
- **Benefit**: Eliminates errors for years with no data, reduces scraping time

### Connection Pool Settings

- **pool_timeout**: Maximum time to wait for a connection from the pool
- **connect_timeout**: Maximum time to establish a new connection
- **connection_limit**: Maximum number of concurrent connections (unchanged at 20)

## Expected Results

1. **No More Year Selector Errors**: Scraper will skip 2020-2021 years that don't exist
2. **No More P1017 Errors**: Database connections will have sufficient timeout for long operations
3. **Faster Import**: Reduced year range means less scraping time
4. **More Reliable**: Fewer connection drops during import process

## Build Status

✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: No errors
✅ **ESLint Validation**: Clean
✅ **Next.js Build**: Successful
✅ **Ready for Testing**: Yes

The import system is now optimized and ready for testing with the fixed year range and improved database connection stability.
