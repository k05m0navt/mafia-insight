# Implementation Plan: Fix Critical Infrastructure Issues

**Branch**: `008-fix-critical-issues` | **Date**: 2025-01-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/008-fix-critical-issues/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Fix critical infrastructure issues in the Mafia Insight application to restore test suite reliability (from 0% to 60%+ pass rate), implement robust authentication system, establish comprehensive error handling, and achieve 80%+ test coverage across all test types. The approach focuses on database connection stability, authentication service implementation, error boundary creation, and comprehensive testing infrastructure improvements.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Node.js 18+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, Prisma, Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM)  
**Testing**: Vitest (unit/integration), Playwright (E2E), React Testing Library (component)  
**Target Platform**: Web application (browser-based)  
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js full-stack)  
**Performance Goals**: <2 seconds user interaction response, <5 minutes test execution  
**Constraints**: Must support local development, CI/CD pipeline, and staging environments  
**Scale/Scope**: 195 existing tests, comprehensive test coverage across all critical functionality

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### Clean Architecture Compliance ✅

- **Requirement**: All code MUST follow Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns
- **Status**: PASS - This feature focuses on infrastructure fixes that will enable Clean Architecture implementation
- **Justification**: Fixing test infrastructure and authentication services provides the foundation for Clean Architecture

### Test-Driven Development ✅

- **Requirement**: TDD is MANDATORY for all development. Tests MUST be written before implementation
- **Status**: PASS - This feature specifically addresses the 0% test pass rate and implements comprehensive testing
- **Justification**: The primary goal is to restore test reliability and achieve 80%+ coverage

### Spec-Driven Development ✅

- **Requirement**: All features MUST start with comprehensive specifications before any code is written
- **Status**: PASS - Feature specification is complete with user stories, requirements, and success criteria
- **Justification**: Specification includes prioritized user stories and measurable outcomes

### Modern Frontend Best Practices ✅

- **Requirement**: Components MUST be reusable, accessible, and performant
- **Status**: PASS - Error boundaries and state management improvements align with modern practices
- **Justification**: Error handling and component testing improvements support modern frontend standards

### Package Management & Documentation ✅

- **Requirement**: Yarn MUST be used exclusively for package management
- **Status**: PASS - Project uses yarn as specified in package.json
- **Justification**: No changes to package management approach

### Code Quality & Standards ✅

- **Requirement**: All code MUST pass linting and formatting checks
- **Status**: PASS - Infrastructure fixes will improve code quality and enable proper linting
- **Justification**: Test infrastructure fixes enable proper code quality validation

**Overall Status**: ✅ ALL GATES PASS - Proceed to Phase 0 research

### Post-Design Constitution Check ✅

- **Clean Architecture**: PASS - Infrastructure fixes enable Clean Architecture implementation
- **Test-Driven Development**: PASS - Comprehensive testing strategy implemented
- **Spec-Driven Development**: PASS - Complete specification with research and design artifacts
- **Modern Frontend Best Practices**: PASS - Error boundaries and state management align with best practices
- **Package Management**: PASS - Yarn usage maintained
- **Code Quality**: PASS - Testing infrastructure enables proper code quality validation

**Overall Status**: ✅ ALL GATES PASS - Ready for implementation

**Structure Decision**: Web application using Next.js full-stack architecture with existing project structure. The focus is on fixing existing infrastructure rather than restructuring, maintaining the current src/ and tests/ organization while improving the underlying implementation.

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
