## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Restore Test Infrastructure Reliability (Priority: P1)

Developers can run the test suite successfully without critical failures, enabling continuous integration and reliable code validation.

**Why this priority**: The current 0% test success rate (0 out of 195 tests passing) completely blocks development workflow and prevents any reliable code validation. This is the foundation that must be fixed before any other improvements.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the complete test suite and achieving at least 60% pass rate, with all critical infrastructure tests (database, authentication, validation) passing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clean development environment, **When** developers run `yarn test`, **Then** the test suite executes without crashes and achieves at least 60% pass rate
2. **Given** a failing test environment, **When** developers run database connection tests, **Then** all database integration tests pass without connection errors
3. **Given** a test environment with timeout issues, **When** developers run long-running tests, **Then** all tests complete within reasonable time limits without timing out

---

### User Story 2 - Establish Reliable Authentication System (Priority: P1)

Users can successfully authenticate and access protected features without system crashes or undefined function errors.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is fundamental to application security and user experience. The current `authService.isAuthenticated is not a function` error completely breaks the authentication system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by implementing a working authentication service and verifying that login/logout functionality works without errors, and that protected routes are properly secured.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with valid credentials, **When** they attempt to log in, **Then** authentication succeeds without undefined function errors
2. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they access protected features, **Then** they can successfully interact with the application
3. **Given** an unauthenticated user, **When** they attempt to access protected routes, **Then** they are properly redirected to login

---

### User Story 3 - Implement Robust Error Handling (Priority: P2)

Users experience graceful error handling with clear feedback when issues occur, rather than application crashes or silent failures.

**Why this priority**: The current lack of error boundaries and proper error handling creates a poor user experience and makes debugging difficult. This is essential for production readiness.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by introducing various error conditions and verifying that the application handles them gracefully with appropriate user feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a component encounters an error, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the application displays a user-friendly error message instead of crashing
2. **Given** a network request fails, **When** the failure occurs, **Then** the user sees appropriate feedback and can retry the action
3. **Given** form validation fails, **When** users submit invalid data, **Then** they receive clear, specific error messages for each field

---

### User Story 4 - Achieve Comprehensive Test Coverage (Priority: P2)

The development team has confidence in code changes through comprehensive test coverage that validates all critical functionality.

**Why this priority**: While not as critical as fixing the infrastructure, comprehensive test coverage is essential for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions as the application grows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the test suite and achieving 90%+ coverage across all critical components and business logic.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a codebase with comprehensive tests, **When** developers make changes, **Then** they can verify their changes don't break existing functionality
2. **Given** a new feature implementation, **When** tests are written, **Then** all critical paths and edge cases are covered
3. **Given** a failing test, **When** developers investigate, **Then** they can quickly identify the root cause and fix the issue

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when database connection is lost during test execution?
- How does the system handle authentication token expiration during user sessions?
- What occurs when validation functions receive malformed or unexpected data?
- How does the application behave when external services are unavailable?
- What happens when test data is corrupted or missing?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST establish stable database connections for local development, CI/CD pipeline, and staging environments
