# Tasks: Gomafia Data Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-gomafia-data-sync/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED as per constitution. TDD approach with tests written first.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below based on Next.js web application structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and dependency installation

- [x] T001 Install Playwright for browser automation with `yarn add playwright`
- [x] T002 Install Playwright test dependencies with `yarn add -D @playwright/test`
- [x] T003 [P] Configure Playwright browsers with `npx playwright install chromium`
- [x] T004 [P] Update environment variables in `.env.local` with sync configuration
- [x] T005 [P] Add sync-related environment variables to `.env.example`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Database schema and core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 Create database migration for SyncLog model in `prisma/migrations/[timestamp]_add_sync_tables/migration.sql`
- [x] T007 Create database migration for SyncStatus model in `prisma/migrations/[timestamp]_add_sync_tables/migration.sql`
- [x] T008 [P] Update Player model with sync tracking fields (lastSyncAt, syncStatus) in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- [x] T009 [P] Update Game model with sync tracking fields (lastSyncAt, syncStatus) in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- [x] T010 Generate Prisma client with `yarn db:generate`
- [x] T011 Apply database migrations with `yarn db:migrate` - Applied via Supabase MCP
- [x] T012 Create Zod validation schemas for SyncLog in `src/lib/validations/syncSchemas.ts`
- [x] T013 Create Zod validation schemas for Player sync data in `src/lib/validations/playerSchemas.ts`
- [x] T014 Create Zod validation schemas for Game sync data in `src/lib/validations/gameSchemas.ts`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1 data to display
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1 with error handling
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1 sync operations

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (REQUIRED) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for player parsing logic in tests/unit/parsers/gomafiaParser.test.ts"
Task: "Unit test for game parsing logic in tests/unit/parsers/gomafiaParser.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test for full sync workflow in tests/integration/sync/fullSync.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test for incremental sync workflow in tests/integration/sync/incrementalSync.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test for retry logic in tests/integration/sync/retryLogic.test.ts"

# Launch all database operations together:
Task: "Create SyncLog database operations in src/lib/db/syncLog.ts"
Task: "Create SyncStatus database operations in src/lib/db/syncStatus.ts"
Task: "Implement Player sync operations in src/lib/db/syncPlayer.ts"
Task: "Implement Game sync operations in src/lib/db/syncGame.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Data Sync)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Data Display)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (Sync Status)
3. After US1, US2, US4 complete:
   - All developers: User Story 3 (Error Handling)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 98 tasks

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: 5 tasks
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: 11 tasks
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: 21 tasks (5 tests + 16 implementation)
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: 21 tasks (4 tests + 17 implementation - includes 4 filtering tasks)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: 14 tasks (3 tests + 11 implementation)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: 14 tasks (4 tests + 10 implementation)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: 15 tasks (includes 1 deferred export task)

**Parallel Opportunities**: 45+ tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 (Setup + Foundational + User Story 1) = 37 tasks

**Independent Test Criteria**:

- US1: Successfully parse data from gomafia.pro, store in database, verify accessibility
- US2: Display player data, game records, and basic statistics in web interface
- US3: Handle malformed data gracefully with error logging and fallback behavior
- US4: Display sync status, manually trigger sync, and view sync logs in web interface

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests are REQUIRED and MUST be written first before implementation
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
