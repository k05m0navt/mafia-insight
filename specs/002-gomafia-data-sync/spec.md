# Feature Specification: Gomafia Data Integration

**Feature Branch**: `002-gomafia-data-sync`  
**Created**: December 2024  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "As a user, I want to see all the data from gomafia in the app. I need to parse data from the gomafia, the store it inside supabase and then have access to the data from web app. Also, use shadcn components. use context7. use supabase MCP. use shadcn mcp. We already have @001-mafia-analytics/ feature, but I alreay merge and delete branch 001-mafia-analytics to the main branch"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Data Synchronization (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want the system to automatically fetch and sync all player and game data from gomafia.pro so that I can access the latest information without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability - without data synchronization, the application cannot display any information. This drives all other features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by successfully parsing data from gomafia.pro, storing it in the database, and displaying it in the web interface, delivering immediate value to users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the system is configured to sync with gomafia.pro, **When** the sync job runs, **Then** all player and game data is successfully parsed and stored
2. **Given** data already exists in the database, **When** new data is available on gomafia.pro, **Then** the system updates existing records and adds new ones
3. **Given** a sync fails due to network issues, **When** the system retries, **Then** it successfully completes the sync on retry

### User Story 2 - Data Display in Web App (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to view all synchronized gomafia data in the web application so that I can access player statistics, game history, and analytics.

**Why this priority**: Data synchronization is only valuable if users can access and interact with the data through the web interface. This enables the core user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by displaying player data, game records, and basic statistics in the web interface using shadcn components, delivering visual value to users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** data has been synchronized, **When** a user visits the players page, **Then** they see a list of all players with basic statistics
2. **Given** a user selects a player, **When** they view the player details, **Then** they see comprehensive game history and statistics
3. **Given** data is still loading, **When** the page renders, **Then** users see appropriate loading indicators

### User Story 3 - Data Management & Error Handling (Priority: P3)

As an administrator, I want the system to handle data inconsistencies and errors gracefully so that data integrity is maintained even when source data has issues.

**Why this priority**: Robust error handling ensures system reliability and data quality, preventing issues from cascading to end users. This is important but secondary to core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by introducing malformed data and verifying the system handles it appropriately with error logging and fallback behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** gomafia.pro returns malformed data, **When** the system attempts to parse it, **Then** errors are logged and the system continues processing other records
2. **Given** a sync operation is interrupted, **When** the system resumes, **Then** it continues from where it left off without duplicating data
3. **Given** invalid data is detected, **When** the system processes it, **Then** appropriate validation errors are logged for review

---

### User Story 4 - Sync Status Management (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to view sync status, manually trigger sync operations, and access sync logs so that I can monitor data synchronization and manage the sync process.

**Why this priority**: Users need visibility into sync operations to understand data freshness and troubleshoot issues. Manual sync capability provides control over data updates.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by displaying sync status, triggering manual sync, and viewing sync logs in the web interface with appropriate status updates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the system has sync status data, **When** a user views the sync status page, **Then** they see current sync status, last sync time, and progress
2. **Given** a user wants to sync data immediately, **When** they click the manual sync button, **Then** a sync operation is triggered and status updates are displayed
3. **Given** sync operations have occurred, **When** a user views sync logs, **Then** they see a history of sync operations with details

---

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

**Data Availability Issues:**

- **EC-001**: When gomafia.pro is unavailable, the system MUST retry automatically with exponential backoff, cache the last known state, and display appropriate status messages to users
- **EC-002**: When gomafia.pro returns partial data, the system MUST store available data, flag incomplete records, and attempt to complete them on subsequent syncs
- **EC-003**: Network timeouts during data fetching MUST trigger retry logic with a maximum of 5 attempts before marking the sync as failed

**Data Consistency:**

- **EC-004**: Duplicate records from gomafia.pro MUST be detected and deduplicated based on unique identifiers before storage
- **EC-005**: Data schema changes in gomafia.pro MUST be handled gracefully with schema validation and migration support
- **EC-006**: Conflicts between existing database records and incoming data MUST be resolved based on timestamps and data freshness

**Performance & Scale:**

- **EC-007**: Large datasets (>10,000 records) MUST be processed in batches to prevent memory issues and timeouts
- **EC-008**: Concurrent sync operations MUST be prevented through locking mechanisms to avoid race conditions
- **EC-009**: Database write operations MUST be optimized with batching and transaction management

**User Experience:**

- **EC-010**: Sync status MUST be visible to users through status indicators in the web interface
- **EC-011**: Users MUST be able to manually trigger data synchronization on demand
- **EC-012**: Sync errors MUST be communicated to users in user-friendly messages without technical details

## Requirements _(mandatory)_
