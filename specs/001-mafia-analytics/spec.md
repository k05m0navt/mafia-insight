# Feature Specification: Sport Mafia Game Analytics Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-mafia-analytics`  
**Created**: December 2024  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Use @docs/ as a start point. All the docs is refs to @MASTER-REFERENCE.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Player Performance Analytics (Priority: P1)

As a competitive Mafia player, I want to view my performance analytics and statistics so that I can understand my strengths and weaknesses across different roles (Don, Mafia, Sheriff, Citizen).

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - individual players need to see their performance data to improve their game. This drives user engagement and retention.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by displaying a player's historical performance data with role-specific metrics and trends, delivering immediate value to individual users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player has played multiple games, **When** they view their analytics dashboard, **Then** they see their win rate, role performance, and trend data
2. **Given** a player selects a specific role filter, **When** they view analytics, **Then** they see only data relevant to that role with appropriate color coding
3. **Given** a player wants to compare their performance, **When** they view their stats, **Then** they see how they rank against other players

### User Story 2 - Team Analytics Dashboard (Priority: P2)

As a club manager or team captain, I want to view team performance analytics so that I can track member progress and team statistics.

**Why this priority**: Team analytics enable club management and team coordination, which drives community engagement and premium subscriptions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by displaying team/club performance metrics, member statistics, and team rankings, delivering value to team leaders.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a team has multiple members, **When** a manager views team analytics, **Then** they see overall team performance and individual member contributions
2. **Given** a team participates in tournaments, **When** viewing team stats, **Then** they see tournament results and team rankings
3. **Given** a manager wants to track member progress, **When** viewing team dashboard, **Then** they see member performance trends over time

### User Story 3 - Tournament Analytics (Priority: P3)

As a tournament organizer, I want to view tournament statistics and live updates so that I can manage tournaments effectively and provide insights to participants.

**Why this priority**: Tournament features enable premium subscriptions and community building, but are secondary to individual and team analytics.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by displaying tournament brackets, live statistics, and participant performance during tournaments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tournament is in progress, **When** an organizer views tournament dashboard, **Then** they see live game updates and participant statistics
2. **Given** a tournament has concluded, **When** viewing tournament results, **Then** they see final standings and performance summaries
3. **Given** participants want to track their tournament performance, **When** viewing tournament analytics, **Then** they see their individual game results and overall tournament ranking

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

**Data Availability Issues:**

- **EC-001**: When gomafia.pro data is unavailable, the system MUST display cached data with a timestamp indicating last successful sync and a retry button. Users MUST see a clear message explaining temporary unavailability.
- **EC-002**: When data from gomafia.pro is incomplete, the system MUST flag incomplete records and allow partial display with visual indicators for missing fields.
- **EC-003**: Data sync failures MUST be logged and trigger an automatic retry after 5 minutes, with a maximum of 3 retry attempts before notifying administrators.

**Data Consistency:**

- **EC-004**: Players with no historical data MUST see an empty state with onboarding guidance to play their first game.
- **EC-005**: Multiple players with the same name MUST be distinguished by unique player IDs and displayed with disambiguation (e.g., "John Doe #123").
- **EC-006**: When tournament data includes incomplete games, the system MUST clearly mark unfinished games and exclude them from win/loss calculations until completion.

**Performance & Validation:**

- **EC-007**: Frequent role changes within a single game session MUST be tracked with timestamps to maintain accurate role-based statistics.
- **EC-008**: Data inconsistencies from gomafia.pro MUST trigger validation warnings logged for review, with fallback to most recent consistent state.
- **EC-009**: Invalid or malformed data MUST be rejected with descriptive error messages and logged for debugging purposes.

**User Experience:**

- **EC-010**: Export requests for large datasets (>1000 records) MUST show progress indication and provide email notification upon completion.
- **EC-011**: Real-time updates MUST gracefully degrade to polling mode if WebSocket connection fails, with automatic reconnection attempts.
- **EC-012**: Mobile users with poor connectivity MUST be able to view cached analytics data with offline indicators.
