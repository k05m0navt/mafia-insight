# Tasks: Sport Mafia Game Analytics Platform

**Feature**: Sport Mafia Game Analytics Platform  
**Branch**: `001-mafia-analytics`  
**Created**: December 2024  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Summary

This task list implements a comprehensive Sport Mafia Game Analytics platform with role-based analytics (Don, Mafia, Sheriff, Citizen) for individual players, teams, and tournaments. The platform uses Next.js with TypeScript, Supabase for backend services, and implements a PWA for mobile access.

**Total Tasks**: 77  
**User Stories**: 3 (P1, P2, P3)  
**Parallel Opportunities**: 15+ tasks can be executed in parallel  
**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Player Performance Analytics)

## Dependencies

### Story Completion Order

1. **Phase 1-2**: Setup and Foundational (MUST complete first)
2. **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - Player Performance Analytics (P1)
3. **Phase 4**: User Story 2 - Team Analytics Dashboard (P2)
4. **Phase 5**: User Story 3 - Tournament Analytics (P3)
5. **Phase 6**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Story Dependencies

- **US2** depends on **US1** (Team analytics need player data)
