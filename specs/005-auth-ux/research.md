# Research: Enhanced Authentication UX and User Management

**Feature**: Enhanced Authentication UX and User Management  
**Date**: 2025-01-26  
**Purpose**: Resolve technical unknowns and establish implementation patterns

## Research Tasks

### 1. Supabase Authentication Error Handling Patterns

**Task**: Research Supabase authentication error handling patterns for user-friendly error messages

**Decision**: Implement custom error mapping with user-friendly messages

**Rationale**:

- Supabase returns technical error codes (e.g., `invalid_credentials`, `email_not_confirmed`)
- Users need clear, actionable messages instead of technical jargon
- Custom error mapping allows for consistent UX across all auth flows

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Using Supabase default error messages (too technical)
- Generic error messages (not helpful for users)
- Custom error handling per component (inconsistent)

**Implementation**:

- Create error mapping service in `/lib/auth/error-mapping.ts`
- Map Supabase error codes to user-friendly messages
- Include actionable next steps for each error type

### 2. NextAuth.js and Supabase Integration Best Practices

**Task**: Research best practices for integrating NextAuth.js with Supabase for session management

**Decision**: Use Supabase Auth as primary auth provider with NextAuth.js for session management

**Rationale**:

- Supabase provides robust authentication with built-in user management
- NextAuth.js offers excellent session management and middleware
- Combination provides best of both worlds: Supabase's auth features + NextAuth's session handling

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Supabase Auth only (limited session management features)
- NextAuth.js only (would need to rebuild user management)
- Custom session management (reinventing the wheel)

**Implementation**:

- Configure NextAuth.js with Supabase provider
- Use Supabase for user CRUD operations
- Leverage NextAuth.js for session persistence and middleware

### 3. Form Data Preservation During Authentication Recovery

**Task**: Research patterns for preserving form data during authentication recovery flows

**Decision**: Use localStorage with encryption for form data preservation

**Rationale**:

- localStorage persists across page reloads and browser sessions
- Encryption ensures sensitive data is protected
- Simple implementation with good browser support
- Works with all form types across the application

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Session storage (lost on tab close)
- Server-side storage (complex, requires user identification)
- URL parameters (limited data size, security concerns)

**Implementation**:

- Create form data service in `/lib/forms/preservation.ts`
- Encrypt sensitive data before storing
- Auto-save form data on input changes
- Restore data after successful authentication

### 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation Patterns

**Task**: Research RBAC implementation patterns for Next.js applications

**Decision**: Implement middleware-based RBAC with role hierarchy

**Rationale**:

- Middleware runs before page rendering, ensuring security
- Role hierarchy simplifies permission checking
- Centralized access control logic
- Easy to test and maintain

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Component-level permission checks (scattered logic)
- API-only permission checks (client-side bypass risk)
- Database-level RLS only (limited flexibility)

**Implementation**:

- Create role hierarchy: Guest < User < Admin
- Implement middleware for route protection
- Create permission checking utilities
- Use Supabase RLS for database-level security

### 5. User Invitation System with Email Templates

**Task**: Research user invitation system patterns with email templates

**Decision**: Use Supabase Auth invitations with custom email templates

**Rationale**:

- Supabase provides built-in invitation system
- Custom email templates ensure consistent branding
- 7-day expiration aligns with security best practices
- Integrates seamlessly with existing auth flow

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Custom invitation system (complex, security concerns)
- Third-party email service (additional dependency)
- Manual user creation (no invitation flow)

**Implementation**:

- Configure Supabase email templates
- Create invitation API endpoints
- Implement invitation acceptance flow
- Add invitation management UI for admins

### 6. Error Tracking and Monitoring for Authentication

**Task**: Research error tracking patterns for authentication monitoring

**Decision**: Implement structured error logging with user context

**Rationale**:

- Authentication errors are critical for security monitoring
- User context helps with debugging and support
- Structured logging enables better analytics
- Integration with existing monitoring systems

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Basic console logging (not production-ready)
- Third-party error tracking (additional cost)
- No error tracking (poor observability)

**Implementation**:

- Create error tracking service in `/lib/monitoring/`
- Log all authentication events with context
- Include user ID, action, error type, and timestamp
- Integrate with existing monitoring infrastructure

## Technical Decisions Summary

| Decision                   | Rationale                    | Impact                               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Custom error mapping       | User-friendly error messages | High - improves UX significantly     |
| NextAuth + Supabase        | Best of both worlds          | Medium - simplifies implementation   |
| localStorage for form data | Simple, secure, persistent   | Medium - enables data preservation   |
| Middleware-based RBAC      | Centralized, secure          | High - ensures proper access control |
| Supabase invitations       | Built-in, secure             | Low - leverages existing features    |
| Structured error logging   | Better monitoring            | Medium - improves observability      |

## Dependencies Resolved

- **Supabase Auth**: Confirmed for user management and authentication
- **NextAuth.js**: Confirmed for session management
- **Email Templates**: Will use Supabase's built-in template system
- **Error Handling**: Custom mapping service required
- **Form Preservation**: localStorage with encryption
- **RBAC**: Middleware-based implementation

## Next Steps

1. Implement error mapping service
2. Configure NextAuth.js with Supabase
3. Create form data preservation service
4. Implement RBAC middleware
5. Set up user invitation system
6. Configure error tracking
