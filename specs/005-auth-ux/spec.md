# Feature Specification: Enhanced Authentication UX and User Management

**Feature Branch**: `005-auth-ux`  
**Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I would like, as a user, to see perfect UX/UI, when I am unautherize, because right now it is not clear to undrstand, what is the problem. Also, I need to have an opportunity to create new users with proper rights. use context7. use supabase mcp. use playwright mcp. use web."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-26

- Q: When administrators create new users, how should role assignment work? → A: Admin assigns role during creation, can modify roles later
- Q: How detailed should authentication error messages be for end users? → A: Specific error codes with user-friendly explanations
- Q: How long should user invitations remain valid before expiring? → A: 7 days
- Q: When preserving user data during authentication recovery, what scope should be covered? → A: All form data across the application
- Q: Who should be able to create new user accounts in the system? → A: Only existing admins can create new users

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Clear Authentication Error Messaging (Priority: P1)

As an unauthenticated user, I want to see clear, actionable error messages when authentication fails, so I understand exactly what went wrong and how to fix it.

**Why this priority**: This directly addresses the core user pain point - unclear error messages that leave users confused about authentication issues. This is the most critical UX improvement needed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to access protected resources without authentication and verifying that error messages are clear, specific, and actionable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is not authenticated, **When** they try to access the Players page, **Then** they see a clear message "Please sign in to view player data" with a "Sign In" button
2. **Given** a user has an expired session, **When** they try to perform an action, **Then** they see "Your session has expired. Please sign in again" with a "Sign In" button
3. **Given** a user has insufficient permissions, **When** they try to access admin features, **Then** they see "You don't have permission to access this feature. Contact an administrator if you believe this is an error"

### User Story 2 - User Registration and Role Management (Priority: P1)

As an administrator, I want to create new users with appropriate roles and permissions, so I can manage access to different features of the application.

**Why this priority**: This addresses the second core requirement for user management capabilities. Essential for proper access control and system administration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having an admin user create new accounts with different roles and verifying that role-based access control works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin user is logged in, **When** they access the user management page, **Then** they can see a "Create New User" button
2. **Given** an admin user clicks "Create New User", **When** they fill out the form with email, name, and role, **Then** the system creates the user and sends them an invitation email
3. **Given** a new user receives an invitation, **When** they click the invitation link, **Then** they can set their password and access the application with their assigned role

---

### User Story 3 - Authentication Status Indicators (Priority: P2)

As any user, I want to clearly see my authentication status and available actions, so I always know whether I'm signed in and what I can do.

**Why this priority**: Improves overall user experience by providing clear visual feedback about authentication state and available actions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by checking that authentication status is clearly displayed in the UI and that appropriate actions are available based on the user's state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is not authenticated, **When** they visit any page, **Then** they see a "Sign In" button in the navigation
2. **Given** a user is authenticated, **When** they visit any page, **Then** they see their name/email and a "Sign Out" button in the navigation
3. **Given** a user is authenticated as admin, **When** they visit any page, **Then** they see an additional "User Management" link in the navigation

---

### User Story 4 - Graceful Error Recovery (Priority: P2)

As a user experiencing authentication errors, I want to be able to easily recover and continue using the application, so I don't lose my work or get stuck.

**Why this priority**: Prevents user frustration and improves the overall experience when things go wrong.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating various authentication error scenarios and verifying that users can recover without losing their progress.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user's session expires while filling out a form, **When** they try to submit, **Then** they see a message asking them to sign in again and their form data is preserved
2. **Given** a user encounters a network error during authentication, **When** they retry, **Then** they see a "Retry" button and helpful troubleshooting tips
3. **Given** a user receives an authentication error, **When** they click "Sign In", **Then** they are redirected to the login page and can return to their original location after successful authentication

---

### User Story 5 - Role-Based Feature Visibility (Priority: P3)

As a user with specific permissions, I want to only see features and options that I'm authorized to use, so the interface is clean and relevant to my role.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience by reducing confusion and preventing unauthorized access attempts.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in with different user roles and verifying that only appropriate features are visible and accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a regular user is logged in, **When** they view the navigation, **Then** they don't see admin-only features like "User Management"
2. **Given** an admin user is logged in, **When** they view the navigation, **Then** they see all available features including "User Management"
3. **Given** a user tries to access a feature they don't have permission for, **When** they navigate to that URL, **Then** they see a clear message explaining they don't have access

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's authentication token expires while they're in the middle of a critical operation?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues during authentication?
- What happens when a user tries to access a resource that requires higher permissions than they have?
- How does the system handle invalid or malformed authentication tokens?
- What happens when a user tries to create an account with an email that already exists?
- How does the system handle users who try to access the application from multiple devices simultaneously?
