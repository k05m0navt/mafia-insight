# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Authentication UX and User Management

**Branch**: `005-auth-ux` | **Date**: 2025-01-26 | **Spec**: [specs/005-auth-ux/spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-auth-ux/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement enhanced authentication UX with clear error messaging and comprehensive user management system. The feature addresses user confusion with authentication errors by providing specific, actionable error messages and enables administrators to create and manage users with proper role-based access control.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Next.js 14, React 18  
**Primary Dependencies**: Supabase Auth, NextAuth.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL via Supabase, Redis for session management  
**Testing**: Jest, Playwright, React Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)  
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js full-stack)  
**Performance Goals**: <3s page load, <1s auth status display, <2min user creation  
**Constraints**: <200ms API response time, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, mobile responsive  
**Scale/Scope**: 1k+ users, 5 main pages, 3 user roles (Guest/User/Admin)

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### Clean Architecture Compliance ✅

- **Use Cases**: Authentication and user management use cases will be isolated in domain layer
- **Dependency Inversion**: Business logic will not depend on Supabase directly, will use interfaces
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, and data access will be clearly separated

### Test-Driven Development ✅

- **TDD Mandatory**: All components will be test-driven with Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **Test Coverage**: Target 80%+ coverage for all new code
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for components, integration tests for auth flows, contract tests for APIs

### Spec-Driven Development ✅

- **Comprehensive Spec**: Feature specification is complete with user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Independent Stories**: Each user story can be developed and tested independently
- **Measurable Criteria**: Success criteria are quantifiable and testable

### Modern Frontend Best Practices ✅

- **Component Architecture**: Reusable, accessible components using shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: Predictable state with React hooks and context
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all UI components

### Package Management & Documentation ✅

- **Yarn Only**: Will use yarn exclusively for all package operations
- **Context7 MCP**: Will use Context7 for accessing Supabase documentation
- **Documentation**: All new code will be properly documented

### Code Quality & Standards ✅

- **Linting**: All code will pass ESLint and TypeScript checks
- **Performance**: Will meet defined performance targets (<3s load, <1s auth display)
- **Security**: Will follow security best practices for authentication

**Structure Decision**: Next.js App Router structure with clear separation of concerns. Authentication logic isolated in `/lib/auth/`, user management in `/lib/users/`, and UI components organized by feature area. Clean Architecture principles maintained with business logic separated from framework concerns.

## Phase 0: Research Complete ✅

**Research Artifacts Generated**:

- `research.md` - Technical decisions and implementation patterns
- Error handling patterns for user-friendly messages
- NextAuth.js + Supabase integration approach
- Form data preservation using localStorage with encryption
- Middleware-based RBAC implementation
- User invitation system with 7-day expiration
- Structured error logging for monitoring

## Phase 1: Design Complete ✅

**Design Artifacts Generated**:

- `data-model.md` - Complete entity definitions and relationships
- `contracts/auth-api.yaml` - OpenAPI specification for authentication APIs
- `quickstart.md` - Implementation guide and usage examples
- Agent context updated with new technologies

**Key Design Decisions**:

- Custom error mapping service for user-friendly messages
- NextAuth.js for session management with Supabase Auth
- localStorage with encryption for form data preservation
- Middleware-based role hierarchy (Guest < User < Admin)
- Supabase invitation system with custom email templates
- Structured error logging with user context

## Complexity Tracking

> **No Constitution violations detected - all principles followed**

The implementation follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive test coverage requirements, and modern frontend best practices. No complexity violations require justification.
