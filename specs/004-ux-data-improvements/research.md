# Research: UX/UI and Data Improvements

**Feature**: 004-ux-data-improvements  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Phase**: 0 - Research

## Research Tasks

### 1. React Input Field Debouncing Best Practices

**Task**: Research React input field debouncing patterns for preventing page reloads

**Decision**: Use useDebounce hook with 300ms delay and useEffect for search triggers

**Rationale**:

- Prevents excessive API calls during typing
- Maintains input focus and prevents page reloads
- Standard pattern in modern React applications
- 300ms provides good balance between responsiveness and performance

**Alternatives considered**:

- useCallback with setTimeout (more complex state management)
- Lodash debounce (additional dependency)
- Custom debounce implementation (reinventing wheel)

**Implementation**: Custom useDebounce hook with useEffect dependency array

### 2. Next.js Navigation Patterns

**Task**: Research comprehensive navigation implementation for Next.js applications

**Decision**: Implement consistent navigation component with role-based visibility

**Rationale**:

- Next.js Link component for client-side navigation
- Role-based conditional rendering for protected routes
- Consistent navigation across all pages
- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu for smaller screens

**Alternatives considered**:

- Server-side navigation (slower, less interactive)
- Third-party navigation libraries (unnecessary complexity)
- Manual route management (error-prone)

**Implementation**: Navigation component with usePathname and role-based rendering

### 3. NextAuth.js Role-Based Access Control

**Task**: Research role-based authentication and authorization patterns

**Decision**: Implement NextAuth.js with custom role-based middleware

**Rationale**:

- NextAuth.js integrates well with Next.js
- Custom middleware for route protection
- Session-based authentication with role storage
- Easy integration with existing user system

**Alternatives considered**:

- Custom JWT implementation (complex, security risks)
- Third-party auth providers (vendor lock-in)
- Server-side session management (more complex)

**Implementation**: NextAuth.js configuration with custom role middleware

### 4. Real-time Progress Tracking Patterns

**Task**: Research real-time progress tracking for long-running operations

**Decision**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) with 5-second update intervals

**Rationale**:

- SSE provides real-time updates without WebSocket complexity
- 5-second intervals balance real-time feel with performance
- Easy to implement with Next.js API routes
- Automatic reconnection and error handling

**Alternatives considered**:

- WebSockets (overkill for one-way communication)
- Polling (inefficient, higher server load)
- WebRTC (unnecessary complexity)

**Implementation**: SSE endpoint with progress state management

### 5. Theme Switching Implementation

**Task**: Research dark/light theme switching patterns for Next.js

**Decision**: CSS custom properties with localStorage persistence

**Rationale**:

- CSS custom properties provide efficient theme switching
- localStorage for persistence across sessions
- Tailwind CSS dark mode support
- No flash of wrong theme on page load

**Alternatives considered**:

- CSS-in-JS theme switching (runtime overhead)
- Multiple CSS files (maintenance complexity)
- Third-party theme libraries (unnecessary dependency)

**Implementation**: Theme provider with CSS custom properties and localStorage

### 6. GoMafia Region Data Import Strategy

**Task**: Research GoMafia region data structure and import patterns

**Decision**: Import region data from GoMafia API during player import process

**Rationale**:

- GoMafia already has region structure with filterable options
- Import during player data sync maintains consistency
- Region data is relatively static, doesn't need frequent updates
- Leverages existing import infrastructure

**Alternatives considered**:

- Manual region data entry (error-prone, maintenance burden)
- Third-party geographic data (inconsistent with GoMafia)
- Hardcoded region list (not scalable)

**Implementation**: Extend existing import process to include region data

### 7. Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation Generation

**Task**: Research OpenAPI documentation generation for Next.js API routes

**Decision**: Use next-swagger-doc with automatic route scanning

**Rationale**:

- next-swagger-doc integrates well with Next.js
- Automatic route scanning reduces maintenance
- Generates interactive documentation
- Supports both public and private endpoint documentation

**Alternatives considered**:

- Manual OpenAPI specification (maintenance burden)
- Third-party documentation tools (integration complexity)
- Static documentation (not interactive)

**Implementation**: next-swagger-doc configuration with route annotations

### 8. Data Import Conflict Resolution

**Task**: Research timestamp-based conflict resolution patterns

**Decision**: Compare lastSyncAt timestamps and update if external data is newer

**Rationale**:

- Simple and reliable conflict resolution
- Maintains data freshness priority
- Easy to implement and debug
- Consistent with existing sync patterns

**Alternatives considered**:

- Field-level conflict resolution (complex, error-prone)
- User confirmation for conflicts (not scalable)
- Always overwrite (data loss risk)

**Implementation**: Timestamp comparison in import logic with update logging
