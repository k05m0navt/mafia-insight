# Feature Specification: UX/UI and Data Improvements

**Feature Branch**: `004-ux-data-improvements`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "There is some problems, that we have with UX/UI and Data. First, when the user type any text to the input field, the app instantly reloads after each character and after thet, not focus on that field. Also, there too many Invalid tournaments [TournamentsPhase] Valid: 87, Invalid: 1448, Duplicates: 10. Also, too many skips on players stats. Maybe it is okey, just check. There are no navigation see on the home page, so I can only move to the pages, that I provided via buttons. I can not use navbar to navigate to all the pages, because only specific pages provided. There is need a route protection, because common use do not need to have access to /import page and others too. Some of the API need to be protected, some need public. Need to have Documentation for Public and Private API. The progress of the import need to be clear, show the exact percent of the progress and update automatically. The players stats page do not have tournaments history. The players have games number, but there is no understand, what are the games are. There is no year filter for player stats. The players do not have region param. After region param players will have, there is need to have filter of the region inside players list page. We need to update some params of the data, that already exists in the DB, so the scraper do not need to skip the scraping even if the data exists in the DB, because there is need an update of them. Also, there is need to have dark theme in the app. The dark theme need to follow docs, that we already have in the project. use context7. use supabase mcp. use playwright mcp. use web."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Fix Input Field Reload Issue (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to type in search fields without the page reloading after each character, so that I can search efficiently and maintain focus on the input field.

**Why this priority**: This is a critical UX issue that makes the app unusable for searching. Users cannot effectively search for players or other data due to constant page reloads.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by typing in any search field and verifying no page reload occurs, input maintains focus, and search results update smoothly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the players page, **When** they type in the search field, **Then** the page should not reload and the input field should maintain focus
2. **Given** a user is typing in any filter field, **When** they type multiple characters, **Then** the input should remain focused and responsive without page refreshes
3. **Given** a user is searching for players, **When** they type a search term, **Then** results should update smoothly with debounced search (300ms delay)

### User Story 2 - Implement Comprehensive Navigation (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to navigate to all available pages through a consistent navigation system, so that I can easily access all features of the application.

**Why this priority**: Navigation is fundamental to app usability. Users need to discover and access all features through intuitive navigation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying all pages are accessible through navigation menus and the navigation is consistent across all pages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on any page, **When** they look at the navigation, **Then** they should see links to all available pages (Players, Clubs, Tournaments, Games, etc.)
2. **Given** a user is on the home page, **When** they want to navigate to a specific section, **Then** they should be able to use the navigation menu instead of only buttons
3. **Given** a user is on a sub-page, **When** they want to return to the main section, **Then** they should have clear navigation options

---

### User Story 3 - Implement Route Protection and API Security (Priority: P1)

As a system administrator, I want to protect sensitive routes and APIs, so that only authorized users can access administrative functions and sensitive data.

**Why this priority**: Security is critical for protecting sensitive operations like data import and administrative functions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to access protected routes without authentication and verifying proper access control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an unauthenticated user, **When** they try to access /import page, **Then** they should be redirected to login or see access denied
2. **Given** a regular user, **When** they try to access admin APIs, **Then** they should receive 403 Forbidden response
3. **Given** an authenticated admin user, **When** they access protected routes, **Then** they should have full access to administrative functions

---

### User Story 4 - Enhance Import Progress Tracking (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to see detailed, real-time progress of data imports, so that I understand what's happening and can estimate completion time.

**Why this priority**: Import operations can take a long time and users need visibility into progress to understand system status.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting an import operation and verifying progress updates are accurate and real-time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a data import is running, **When** a user views the import status, **Then** they should see exact percentage complete and current operation
2. **Given** an import is in progress, **When** the user refreshes the page, **Then** the progress should update automatically without manual refresh
3. **Given** an import completes, **When** the user views the status, **Then** they should see completion summary with statistics

---

### User Story 5 - Add Player Statistics Enhancements (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to see comprehensive player statistics including tournament history, game details, and year-based filtering, so that I can analyze player performance thoroughly.

**Why this priority**: Player analytics are core to the platform's value proposition and users need detailed insights.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing a player's detailed statistics page and verifying all data is present and filterable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user views a player's statistics page, **When** they look at the data, **Then** they should see tournament history and game details
2. **Given** a user wants to filter player stats by year, **When** they select a year filter, **Then** the statistics should update to show only that year's data
3. **Given** a user sees game numbers, **When** they hover or click for details, **Then** they should understand what each game represents

---

### User Story 6 - Implement Region-Based Filtering (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to filter players by region, so that I can focus on players from specific geographic areas.

**Why this priority**: Regional filtering helps users find relevant players and improves data organization.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding region data to players and verifying filtering works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** players have region information, **When** a user selects a region filter, **Then** only players from that region should be displayed
2. **Given** a user is viewing the players list, **When** they want to see all regions, **Then** they should have an option to clear the region filter
3. **Given** a user filters by region, **When** they search for a player name, **Then** the search should work within the filtered region

---

### User Story 7 - Implement Dark Theme (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to switch between light and dark themes, so that I can use the app comfortably in different lighting conditions and according to my preferences.

**Why this priority**: Dark theme is a common user preference and improves accessibility and user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by toggling between light and dark themes and verifying all components render correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on any page, **When** they toggle the theme, **Then** all components should switch to the selected theme consistently
2. **Given** a user selects dark theme, **When** they navigate between pages, **Then** the theme should persist across all pages
3. **Given** a user refreshes the page, **When** they return to the app, **Then** their theme preference should be remembered

---

### User Story 8 - Improve Data Import Strategy (Priority: P3)

As a system administrator, I want the import system to update existing data when needed, so that the database stays current with the latest information from external sources.

**Why this priority**: Data freshness is important for accurate analytics and user trust in the system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running imports on data that already exists and verifying updates are applied correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** player data exists in the database, **When** new data is available from external source, **Then** the import should update the existing records
2. **Given** tournament data needs updating, **When** the import runs, **Then** it should not skip records that already exist but have newer data
3. **Given** an import completes, **When** data is updated, **Then** the system should log what was updated vs. what was skipped

---

### User Story 9 - Create API Documentation (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation for both public and private endpoints, so that I can understand how to integrate with the system.

**Why this priority**: API documentation is essential for developer experience and system maintainability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reviewing the documentation and verifying it accurately describes all available endpoints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer wants to use the public API, **When** they read the documentation, **Then** they should find clear examples and endpoint descriptions
2. **Given** a developer needs to access private APIs, **When** they check the documentation, **Then** they should see authentication requirements and access controls
3. **Given** API endpoints change, **When** the documentation is updated, **Then** it should reflect the current API structure accurately

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user types very quickly in search fields? (Should handle rapid input without performance issues)
- How does the system handle navigation when a user has no permissions for certain pages? (Should show appropriate access denied messages)
- What happens when an import fails during progress tracking? (Should show error state and allow retry)
- How does the system handle theme switching on slow connections? (Should provide loading states)
- What happens when region data is missing for some players? (Should handle gracefully in filters)
- How does the system handle API rate limiting? (Should provide appropriate error messages)
