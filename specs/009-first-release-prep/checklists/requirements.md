# Specification Quality Checklist: First Production Release Preparation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 30, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **Passed** - The specification focuses on user outcomes and business needs without diving into technical implementation details. It's written in clear language accessible to non-technical stakeholders, describing WHAT needs to be achieved rather than HOW to implement it.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **Passed** - All functional requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "Users see login success feedback within 1 second" rather than "React component renders JWT token"). All user stories have well-defined acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Passed** - The specification covers all critical aspects of preparing the application for first release: authentication UX, data import/sync, data display reliability, codebase quality, and testing. User stories are prioritized appropriately with P1 for critical features and P2 for important but not blocking features.

## Overall Status

✅ **READY FOR PLANNING** - The specification meets all quality criteria and is ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).
