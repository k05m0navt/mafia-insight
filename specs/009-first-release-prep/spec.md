# Feature Specification: First Production Release Preparation

**Feature Branch**: `009-first-release-prep`  
**Created**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Right now, there are some problems with the app. First, after user login, there is no UX/UI feedback, it just redirect to the home page, also, the is no profile UX/UI in the navbar and no profile page. Also, in the sign up, the user fill the form with the name, but it not stored in DB. Also, there is a problem with games, players, tournamens. Also, check, that importing works fine, so you can check via @Browser that the data in gomafia and scraped data are good. Also, there is need that DB contains all the data from gomafia. Also, there is need, that data scraped automatically every 24 hours. Also, check all the files, structure of the repo, check @docs for documentaion of the project, use constinution, that we wrote previously, remove unused files and folder, make the project for its first relase. I will depoly it to Vercel, so it need to be prepared."

- Q: What sample size should be used for data integrity verification? → A: 1% of total records per entity type
- Q: How should the first admin be created and how should admin management work? → A: Provide easy bootstrap method for first admin creation, then admins can add new admins through admin panel

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Complete Authentication Experience (Priority: P1)

As a user logging into the application, I want clear visual feedback and access to my profile, so I know my login succeeded and can manage my account settings. As the first deployer, I need an easy way to create the initial admin account, and as an admin, I need to be able to add new administrators.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the gateway to the application. Without proper feedback and profile management, users cannot confidently use the platform or manage their identity. Admin bootstrapping is critical for initial deployment and ongoing administration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and verifying that success feedback is displayed, profile information appears in the navbar, a profile page is accessible with account management features, the first admin can be created easily, and existing admins can create new admins.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with valid credentials, **When** they successfully log in, **Then** they see a success notification (e.g., "Welcome back, [Name]!"), are redirected to the dashboard, and see their profile picture/avatar in the navbar
2. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they click their profile picture in the navbar, **Then** they see a dropdown menu with options for "Profile", "Settings", and "Sign Out"
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they navigate to their profile page, **Then** they see their account information (name, email, registration date, subscription tier) and can edit their profile details
4. **Given** a user during signup, **When** they fill in their name in the registration form, **Then** the name is properly stored in the User table and displayed throughout the application
5. **Given** a fresh deployment with no admin users, **When** using the bootstrap method (script or page), **Then** the first administrator account is created successfully and can log in with admin privileges
6. **Given** an authenticated administrator, **When** they access the admin panel and create a new admin user, **Then** the new user is created with admin role and receives appropriate credentials or invitation

### User Story 2 - Verified Data Import and Synchronization (Priority: P1)

As a user exploring the platform, I want to see complete, accurate, and up-to-date data from gomafia.pro, so I can trust the analytics and statistics displayed in the application.

**Why this priority**: Data completeness and accuracy are fundamental to the platform's value proposition. Without reliable data import and synchronization, the entire analytics platform becomes unreliable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that the database contains all historical data from gomafia.pro, that imported data matches the source, and that data automatically updates every 24 hours without manual intervention.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** checking the database, **Then** all players, games, clubs, and tournaments from gomafia.pro are present with accurate information
2. **Given** a specific player on gomafia.pro, **When** comparing data in the application, **Then** all statistics (ELO rating, games played, win rates, tournament history) match exactly
3. **Given** the application has been running for 24 hours, **When** checking sync logs, **Then** the system has automatically fetched new data from gomafia.pro and updated the database
4. **Given** new games are added to gomafia.pro, **When** the next automatic sync runs, **Then** those new games appear in the application within 30 minutes

---

### User Story 3 - Reliable Data Display for Games, Players, and Tournaments (Priority: P1)

As a user browsing the platform, I want to view games, players, and tournaments without errors or missing data, so I can analyze mafia game statistics effectively.

**Why this priority**: The core functionality of the platform is displaying game analytics. If users encounter errors or missing data when viewing games, players, or tournaments, the platform fails its primary purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to games, players, and tournaments pages, verifying that all data displays correctly without errors, and that relationships between entities are properly shown.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user on the players page, **When** viewing the player list, **Then** all players display with correct names, ELO ratings, total games, and club affiliations without errors
2. **Given** a user viewing a specific game, **When** checking game details, **Then** all participants, their roles, teams, and the winner are correctly displayed
3. **Given** a user on the tournaments page, **When** viewing tournament details, **Then** all tournament information (name, dates, participants, games, prize pool) is accurate and complete
4. **Given** a user viewing player statistics, **When** checking role-based performance, **Then** statistics for each role (Don, Mafia, Sheriff, Citizen) display accurately with correct win rates

---

### User Story 4 - Production-Ready Codebase (Priority: P2)

As a developer deploying to production, I want a clean, well-organized codebase with proper documentation and no unused files, so the application is maintainable and deployable to Vercel without issues.

**Why this priority**: While not directly visible to users, a clean codebase is essential for maintainability, deployment reliability, and future development. This prevents technical debt from accumulating.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reviewing the repository structure, running build processes, checking for unused files, verifying documentation accuracy, and confirming successful Vercel deployment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the codebase, **When** running the build command, **Then** the application builds successfully without warnings or errors
2. **Given** the repository, **When** reviewing file structure, **Then** no unused files, deprecated code, or temporary test files exist
3. **Given** the documentation, **When** reviewing docs folder, **Then** all documentation is accurate, up-to-date, and reflects the current state of the application
4. **Given** deployment to Vercel, **When** the application is deployed, **Then** it runs successfully with all environment variables properly configured and all features functioning

---

### User Story 5 - Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance (Priority: P2)

As a developer preparing for production release, I want comprehensive test coverage and quality checks, so the application is reliable and stable for end users.

**Why this priority**: Testing ensures the application works reliably before users access it. This prevents production bugs and maintains user trust.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the complete test suite, performing manual browser testing of critical flows, and verifying that all tests pass consistently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the complete test suite, **When** running all tests, **Then** at least 90% of tests pass successfully
2. **Given** critical user flows (authentication, data viewing, navigation), **When** testing manually in a browser, **Then** all flows complete without errors
3. **Given** different user roles (guest, user, admin), **When** testing role-based access, **Then** each role sees only the appropriate features and can perform only authorized actions
4. **Given** the application running locally, **When** importing data and testing synchronization, **Then** all data imports successfully and displays correctly
