# Feature Specification: Browser Testing and Authentication UX Improvements

**Feature Branch**: `006-browser-testing-auth`  
**Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I need to test via browser and with playwright entire application. Also, there is need to update sign up page, login page. Update navbart, so it contains entire navigation and hide the elements, that user do not have access. If the user try to navigate to the page, that he do not have access, show it in a friendly way. Also, the navbar should contain theme toggle, login/logut buttons. Right now I need to hard refresh the browser to see the changes. At the home page I do not see some navigation, but some appear at players page. On the home page I need near the Player Analytics text not Don, but Player. Also, I need to have easy opportunity to update, what type of users have access to some pages. When I have Auth error inside the pages, it looks not friendly."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Complete Application Testing Coverage (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need comprehensive browser testing for the entire application using Playwright to ensure all features work correctly across different user roles and scenarios.

**Why this priority**: Testing is critical for application reliability and prevents regressions. Without comprehensive testing, bugs can reach production and impact user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the complete Playwright test suite and verifying all user flows work correctly across different browsers and user roles.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh application state, **When** I run the Playwright test suite, **Then** all tests pass and cover authentication, navigation, data display, and user interactions
2. **Given** different user roles (authenticated/unauthenticated), **When** I run role-specific tests, **Then** each role sees appropriate content and has correct access permissions
3. **Given** various browser environments, **When** I run cross-browser tests, **Then** the application functions consistently across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari

### User Story 2 - Improved Authentication Pages (Priority: P1)

As a user, I need updated and user-friendly sign-up and login pages that provide clear feedback and smooth user experience.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the entry point for users. Poor UX here directly impacts user adoption and satisfaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to auth pages and verifying improved design, clear error messages, and smooth user flows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I visit the sign-up page, **When** I see the updated design, **Then** it should follow Material Design 3 principles with clear visual hierarchy, consistent spacing (8px grid), accessible color contrast (WCAG AA), and progressive disclosure of form fields
2. **Given** I enter invalid credentials, **When** I submit the form, **Then** I see friendly, specific error messages that help me correct the issue
3. **Given** I successfully authenticate, **When** I am redirected, **Then** I land on the appropriate page based on my user role

---

### User Story 3 - Comprehensive Navigation with Role-Based Access (Priority: P1)

As a user, I need a complete navigation bar that shows all available pages and hides content I don't have access to, with clear feedback when I try to access restricted areas.

**Why this priority**: Navigation is fundamental to user experience. Users need to understand what's available to them and get helpful feedback when access is restricted.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in with different user roles and verifying the navigation shows appropriate options and handles access restrictions gracefully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in as a regular user, **When** I view the navigation bar, **Then** I see all pages I have access to and no restricted content
2. **Given** I am logged in as an admin, **When** I view the navigation bar, **Then** I see all available pages including admin-only sections
3. **Given** I try to access a restricted page, **When** I navigate to it, **Then** I see a friendly message explaining why I can't access it and suggesting alternatives
4. **Given** I am not logged in, **When** I view the navigation, **Then** I see only public pages and clear login/signup options

---

### User Story 4 - Theme Toggle and Authentication Controls (Priority: P2)

As a user, I need easy access to theme switching and login/logout functionality directly from the navigation bar.

**Why this priority**: These are common user needs that should be easily accessible. Theme preference affects user comfort, and authentication controls are essential for security.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by interacting with the theme toggle and login/logout buttons to verify they work correctly and persist user preferences.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on any page, **When** I click the theme toggle, **Then** the application switches between light and dark themes and remembers my preference
2. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I click the logout button, **Then** I am logged out and redirected to the appropriate page
3. **Given** I am not logged in, **When** I click the login button, **Then** I am taken to the login page

---

### User Story 5 - Real-time UI Updates (Priority: P2)

As a user, I need the application to update in real-time without requiring hard browser refreshes to see changes.

**Why this priority**: Modern web applications should provide seamless user experience. Hard refreshes indicate poor state management and hurt user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making changes that should trigger UI updates and verifying they appear automatically without manual refresh.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in and my authentication status changes, **When** the change occurs, **Then** the UI updates immediately to reflect the new state
2. **Given** I navigate between pages, **When** I move to a new page, **Then** the navigation updates to show my current location without refresh
3. **Given** I perform actions that change my access permissions, **When** the changes occur, **Then** the navigation updates to show/hide appropriate options

---

### User Story 6 - Consistent Navigation Across Pages (Priority: P2)

As a user, I need consistent navigation visibility across all pages, not just some pages.

**Why this priority**: Inconsistent navigation creates confusion and makes the application feel unpolished. Users expect consistent UI elements.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating through all pages and verifying navigation appears consistently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the home page, **When** I view the navigation, **Then** I see the complete navigation bar
2. **Given** I navigate to the players page, **When** I view the navigation, **Then** I see the same navigation bar as on other pages
3. **Given** I am on any page, **When** I look for navigation, **Then** it appears in the same location and style

---

### User Story 7 - User-Friendly Error Handling (Priority: P3)

As a user, I need friendly error messages when authentication fails or access is denied, rather than technical error messages.

**Why this priority**: Poor error handling creates frustration and makes users feel the application is broken. Good error messages help users understand and resolve issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering various error conditions and verifying user-friendly messages appear.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I enter incorrect credentials, **When** authentication fails, **Then** I see a specific error message with actionable guidance (e.g., "Invalid email format" with email validation hint, "Password too short" with minimum length requirement)
2. **Given** I try to access a restricted area, **When** access is denied, **Then** I see a friendly message explaining why and suggesting what I can do instead
3. **Given** a system error occurs, **When** I encounter it, **Then** I see a user-friendly message rather than technical error details

---

### User Story 8 - Easy Permission Management (Priority: P3)

As an administrator, I need an easy way to update which user types have access to specific pages without code changes.

**Why this priority**: Permission management should be flexible and manageable. Hard-coded permissions make it difficult to adapt to changing business needs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the permission management interface and verifying changes take effect immediately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am an administrator, **When** I access the permission management interface, **Then** I can see all pages and their current access levels
2. **Given** I want to change page access, **When** I update permissions, **Then** the changes take effect immediately for all users
3. **Given** I modify user role permissions, **When** I save changes, **Then** affected users see updated navigation options without needing to log out and back in

---

### User Story 9 - Corrected Home Page Content (Priority: P3)

As a user, I need the home page to display "Player" instead of "Don" near the Player Analytics text for consistency.

**Why this priority**: Content accuracy is important for user understanding. Inconsistent terminology can confuse users about the application's purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the home page and verifying the text displays correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I visit the home page, **When** I look at the Player Analytics section, **Then** I see "Player" instead of "Don" in the relevant text
2. **Given** I view the home page content, **When** I read the text, **Then** all terminology is consistent with the application's purpose
