## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product**: Complete User Story 1 (Testing Coverage) + User Story 2 (Authentication Pages) + User Story 3 (Navigation System)

This provides:

- Comprehensive test coverage
- Modern authentication experience
- Role-based navigation system
- Foundation for all other features

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Week 1**: Complete US1 (Testing) + US2 (Auth Pages)

3. **Week 3**: Complete US5 (Real-time Updates) + US6 (Consistency)
4. **Week 4**: Complete US7-9 (Error Handling, Permissions, Content)

### Parallel Execution Examples

**Phase 3-4 Parallel** (US1 + US2):

```bash
# Terminal 1: Testing infrastructure
yarn playwright test --project=chromium

# Terminal 2: Authentication components
yarn dev # Start development server for auth testing
```

**Phase 6-8 Parallel** (US4 + US5 + US6):

```bash
# Terminal 1: Theme management
yarn test src/hooks/useTheme.test.ts

# Terminal 2: Real-time updates
yarn test src/hooks/useNavigation.test.ts

# Terminal 3: Navigation consistency
yarn test src/components/navigation/Navbar.test.tsx
```
