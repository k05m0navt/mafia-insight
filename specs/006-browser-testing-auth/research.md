# Research: Browser Testing and Authentication UX Improvements

**Feature**: 006-browser-testing-auth  
**Date**: 2025-01-26  
**Purpose**: Resolve technical unknowns and establish best practices for implementation

## Research Tasks

### 1. Playwright Testing Best Practices for Next.js Applications

**Task**: Research comprehensive Playwright testing patterns for Next.js applications with authentication and role-based access

**Decision**: Use Playwright with Next.js App Router, custom test fixtures, and role-based test data setup

**Rationale**:

- Playwright provides excellent Next.js integration with built-in support for App Router
- Custom fixtures enable consistent test data setup across different user roles
- Page Object Model pattern improves test maintainability and readability
- Cross-browser testing capabilities meet cross-browser compatibility requirements

**Alternatives considered**:

- Cypress: More complex setup for Next.js, less cross-browser support
- Jest + React Testing Library: Limited E2E coverage, requires additional setup for full user flows
- Manual testing: Not scalable, doesn't meet automation requirements

**Implementation approach**:

- Use `@playwright/test` with custom fixtures for user roles
- Implement Page Object Model for reusable page interactions
- Create test data factories for consistent user and permission setup
- Use Playwright's built-in authentication state management

### 2. Real-time UI Updates in Next.js Without Page Refresh

**Task**: Research patterns for real-time UI updates in Next.js applications, particularly for authentication state and navigation changes

**Decision**: Use React Context + useReducer for global state management with localStorage persistence

**Rationale**:

- React Context provides predictable state management across components
- useReducer enables complex state transitions for authentication and navigation
- localStorage ensures theme preferences persist across sessions
- Custom hooks abstract state logic and make components testable
- No additional dependencies required, maintains clean architecture

**Alternatives considered**:

- Redux Toolkit: Overkill for this use case, adds complexity
- Zustand: Good option but Context + useReducer is more standard
- SWR/React Query: Focused on server state, not needed for client-only state
- Server-Sent Events: Unnecessary complexity for client-side state changes

**Implementation approach**:

- Create AuthContext and ThemeContext with custom hooks
- Use useReducer for complex state transitions
- Implement localStorage persistence for theme preferences
- Create custom hooks for navigation state management

### 3. Role-Based Navigation and Permission Management

**Task**: Research patterns for dynamic navigation and permission management in React applications

**Decision**: Use permission-based component rendering with centralized permission configuration

**Rationale**:

- Permission-based rendering provides clean separation of concerns
- Centralized configuration enables easy permission management
- Higher-order components (HOCs) or custom hooks for permission checking
- Type-safe permission definitions prevent runtime errors
- Easy to test and maintain

**Alternatives considered**:

- Route-based protection only: Doesn't hide navigation elements
- Server-side permission checking: Adds complexity, not needed for client-side navigation
- Third-party permission libraries: Unnecessary overhead for simple role-based access

**Implementation approach**:

- Create permission configuration object with role-to-permission mapping
- Implement `usePermissions` hook for component-level permission checking
- Create `ProtectedRoute` and `ProtectedComponent` wrappers
- Use TypeScript enums for role and permission types

### 4. Theme Management and Persistence

**Task**: Research theme switching patterns with persistence in Next.js applications

**Decision**: Use CSS custom properties with localStorage persistence and system preference detection

**Rationale**:

- CSS custom properties provide smooth theme transitions
- localStorage ensures theme persistence across sessions
- System preference detection improves user experience
- No additional dependencies required
- Works well with Tailwind CSS dark mode

**Alternatives considered**:

- CSS-in-JS solutions: Runtime overhead, not needed for simple theme switching
- Third-party theme libraries: Unnecessary complexity
- Server-side theme management: Not needed for client-side preferences

**Implementation approach**:

- Use CSS custom properties for theme variables
- Implement `useTheme` hook with localStorage persistence
- Add system preference detection with `prefers-color-scheme`
- Create theme provider component for app-wide theme management

### 5. Error Handling and User-Friendly Messages

**Task**: Research patterns for user-friendly error handling in React applications

**Decision**: Use error boundaries with custom error types and user-friendly message mapping

**Rationale**:

- Error boundaries catch and handle React errors gracefully
- Custom error types enable specific error handling
- Message mapping provides user-friendly error messages
- Centralized error handling improves maintainability
- Easy to test and extend

**Alternatives considered**:

- Global error handlers only: Less granular control
- Third-party error tracking: Overkill for this use case
- Toast notifications only: Doesn't handle all error scenarios

**Implementation approach**:

- Create custom error types for different error scenarios
- Implement error boundary components for different sections
- Create error message mapping for user-friendly messages
- Add error logging for debugging purposes

## Technology Decisions Summary

| Technology        | Decision                             | Rationale                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Testing           | Playwright + Page Object Model       | Comprehensive E2E coverage, Next.js integration   |
| State Management  | React Context + useReducer           | Predictable state, no external dependencies       |
| Permission System | Permission-based rendering           | Clean separation, easy to test and maintain       |
| Theme Management  | CSS custom properties + localStorage | Smooth transitions, persistence, system detection |
| Error Handling    | Error boundaries + custom types      | Graceful error handling, user-friendly messages   |

## Implementation Notes

- All decisions align with Clean Architecture principles
- No external dependencies added beyond existing stack
- Solutions are testable and maintainable
- Performance requirements are met with chosen approaches
- Cross-browser compatibility ensured through Playwright testing
