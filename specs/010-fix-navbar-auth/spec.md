# Feature Specification: Fix Navbar UI and Authentication Errors

**Feature Branch**: `010-fix-navbar-auth`  
**Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Right now the is an error with navbar UI, so when the user log in and then redirect to the home page, no user icon and also there are log in and sign up buttons. Also, inside the import page, there is an auth error. Check, if there are any any pages that have auth error and fix them. Next feature number is 10"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-26

- Q: What format should user feedback take when authentication errors occur? → A: Toast/notification messages for transient errors, inline error states on affected components
- Q: Which pages should be audited for authentication errors? → A: Comprehensive audit of all pages in the application
- Q: What counts as an "authentication error" that should be fixed? → A: UI state mismatches, unexpected error messages, failed API calls when authenticated, and inconsistent authentication checks (expected redirects for unauthenticated users are NOT errors)
- Q: What should happen when a session expires during user interaction? → A: Show toast notification with option to refresh session, then redirect to login if refresh fails

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Authenticated User Sees Correct Navbar State (Priority: P1)

A user who successfully logs in and is redirected to the home page should immediately see their user icon/profile dropdown in the navbar, not login/signup buttons. The navbar should accurately reflect the user's authenticated state.

**Why this priority**: This is a critical UX issue that confuses users about their authentication status and prevents access to user-specific features from the navbar.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and verifying the navbar displays the user icon/profile dropdown instead of login/signup buttons. This delivers immediate visual confirmation of authentication status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is not authenticated, **When** they view any page with the navbar, **Then** the navbar shows login and signup buttons
2. **Given** a user successfully logs in, **When** they are redirected to any page, **Then** the navbar displays the user icon/profile dropdown with their name and email
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they navigate between pages, **Then** the navbar consistently shows the user icon/profile dropdown across all pages
4. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** the navbar still displays the user icon/profile dropdown (authentication state persists)

### User Story 2 - Import Page Handles Authentication Correctly (Priority: P1)

A user who is authenticated and navigates to the import page should be able to view and use the import functionality without encountering authentication errors.

**Why this priority**: The import page is a core feature that requires authentication, and authentication errors prevent users from accessing critical functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the import page as an authenticated user and verifying no authentication errors appear. This delivers access to import functionality for authenticated users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they navigate to the import page, **Then** the page loads without authentication errors
2. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they view import progress, **Then** the import data is displayed correctly without authentication errors
3. **Given** an authenticated user with appropriate permissions, **When** they start or stop an import, **Then** the operations complete successfully without authentication errors
4. **Given** a non-authenticated user, **When** they attempt to access the import page, **Then** they are redirected to login or shown an appropriate authentication required message

---

### User Story 3 - All Pages Handle Authentication State Consistently (Priority: P2)

All pages in the application should handle authentication state correctly, with no pages showing unexpected authentication errors when accessed by authenticated users.

**Why this priority**: Consistent authentication handling across all pages ensures a smooth user experience and prevents confusion from sporadic authentication errors.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by systematically checking all pages as an authenticated user and verifying no unexpected authentication errors appear. This delivers a consistent, error-free experience across the application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they navigate to any protected page, **Then** the page loads without authentication errors
2. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they access API endpoints from protected pages, **Then** API calls succeed without authentication errors
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they perform actions on protected pages, **Then** all actions complete successfully without authentication errors
4. **Given** authentication state changes (login/logout), **When** the user navigates between pages, **Then** all pages correctly reflect the new authentication state

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's session expires while viewing the import page? The system should show a toast notification with an option to refresh the session, and if refresh fails, redirect to login page
- How does the system handle authentication state when cookies are cleared mid-session? The system should detect the missing authentication and update the UI accordingly
- What happens when authentication check is slow or fails? The system should show appropriate loading states and handle errors gracefully
- How does the system handle authentication state synchronization when multiple tabs are open? All tabs should reflect the same authentication state
- What happens when a user logs in on one tab and navigates on another? Both tabs should reflect the authenticated state

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST update the navbar to display user icon/profile dropdown immediately after successful authentication
- **FR-002**: System MUST synchronize authentication state between authentication service and UI components after login/logout
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle authentication state checks correctly on the import page to prevent authentication errors
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate authentication cookies/tokens consistently across all protected pages and API endpoints
- **FR-005**: System MUST perform a comprehensive audit of all pages in the application for authentication errors (UI state mismatches, unexpected error messages, failed API calls when authenticated, inconsistent authentication checks) and fix any pages that incorrectly handle authentication state. Note: Expected redirects for unauthenticated users are NOT considered errors
- **FR-006**: System MUST properly initialize authentication state on page load and navigation events
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle authentication errors gracefully with appropriate user feedback (toast/notification messages for transient errors, inline error states on affected components)
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain authentication state consistency across page refreshes

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of authenticated users see the correct navbar state (user icon/profile dropdown) immediately after login redirect
- **SC-002**: Zero authentication errors occur when authenticated users access the import page
- **SC-003**: All protected pages load successfully for authenticated users without authentication errors (100% success rate)
- **SC-004**: Authentication state updates are reflected in the navbar within 1 second of login/logout actions
- **SC-005**: Zero authentication-related user-reported issues within the first week after deployment
