# Feature Specification: Admin Dashboard & Import Controls

**Feature Branch**: `011-admin-dashboard`  
**Created**: January 27, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Nex, I would like to create an admin dashboard. Also, I need to have an easy way to stop the current import, also, I need to have a way to clear the DB to start the fresh import. Also, right now, the dark theme is look awfull, you need to get the best practicies to create dark theme for that type of apps."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

- Q: What should the "Clear Database" operation preserve when resetting the database? â†’ A: Preserve all User accounts (both regular users and admin users, since they share the same User table), preserve SyncLog/SyncStatus/ImportCheckpoint/ImportProgress tables for audit history, preserve Region reference data, preserve Notification/DataIntegrityReport/EmailLog tables for system operations history, but delete all imported game data including Player/Club/Game/Tournament/GameParticipation/PlayerRoleStats/PlayerYearStats/PlayerTournament/Analytics tables to enable fresh import

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Comprehensive Admin Dashboard (Priority: P1)

As an administrator, I want access to a centralized dashboard that provides at-a-glance system health, import status, data metrics, and quick access to common administrative tasks, so I can efficiently monitor and manage the platform.

**Why this priority**: The admin dashboard serves as the primary interface for platform management. Without a cohesive dashboard, administrators must navigate multiple pages to gather information, reducing operational efficiency and situational awareness.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as an admin, accessing the dashboard, and verifying that all key metrics, system status indicators, and quick actions are displayed correctly and respond to user interactions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated administrator, **When** they navigate to the admin dashboard, **Then** they see system health metrics (database status, sync status, error counts), recent activity summaries, and quick action cards
2. **Given** the admin dashboard is displayed, **When** administrators view the import status section, **Then** they see current import progress, last sync time, next scheduled sync, and any import errors
3. **Given** the admin dashboard with system alerts, **When** administrators view alerts, **Then** they see critical issues, warnings, and information messages with appropriate severity indicators
4. **Given** the admin dashboard displays quick action buttons, **When** administrators click these buttons, **Then** they are redirected to relevant administrative pages (User Management, Import Controls, Settings, etc.)

### User Story 2 - Import Cancellation (Priority: P1)

As an administrator managing data imports, I want the ability to stop a running import operation safely and immediately, so I can prevent resource waste or data corruption when issues are detected.

**Why this priority**: Import operations can run for hours and consume significant resources. The ability to stop imports is critical for operational control and cost management, especially in cloud environments where resources translate directly to costs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting an import, clicking the stop button, and verifying that the import terminates gracefully, locks are released, partial data is saved or rolled back appropriately, and the system status updates reflect the cancellation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an import operation is in progress, **When** an administrator clicks the "Stop Import" button, **Then** they see a confirmation dialog with information about what will happen (e.g., "Partial data will be saved")
2. **Given** the administrator confirms the stop action, **When** the cancellation is initiated, **Then** the import operation terminates gracefully, all locks are released, and the UI updates to show "Import cancelled by admin" status
3. **Given** an administrator attempts to stop a non-existent import, **When** they click stop, **Then** they see an appropriate message indicating no import is currently running
4. **Given** a cancelled import is resumed later, **When** administrators retry the import, **Then** the system resumes from the last successful checkpoint without creating duplicate records

---

### User Story 3 - Database Clear for Fresh Import (Priority: P1)

As an administrator, I want the ability to clear the database completely and start a fresh import, so I can reset the platform to a clean state when data becomes corrupted, inconsistent, or when major changes require complete re-import.

**Why this priority**: Data integrity issues occasionally require a complete reset. Without this capability, administrators cannot recover from severe data corruption or schema mismatches, potentially requiring manual database intervention.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by confirming the clear action, verifying the database is emptied, attempting to trigger a fresh import, and confirming all data is re-imported successfully from scratch.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator needs to clear the database, **When** they navigate to the Import Controls page and click "Clear Database", **Then** they see a strong warning dialog requiring confirmation and explaining all imported game data will be permanently deleted while user accounts and system configuration are preserved
2. **Given** the administrator confirms the clear action, **When** the clear operation completes, **Then** all imported game data (players, games, tournaments, clubs, etc.) is removed while user accounts, audit logs, and system configuration remain intact, and the admin receives confirmation with option to start fresh import
3. **Given** the database is cleared, **When** administrators start a new import, **Then** the system imports all historical data from gomafia.pro as if it were the first import
4. **Given** an administrator attempts to clear the database while an import is running, **When** they initiate the clear, **Then** they see an error message requiring them to stop the import first

### User Story 4 - Professional Dark Theme (Priority: P2)

As a user who prefers dark mode, I want a well-designed dark theme that applies modern best practices for dark mode interfaces, so I can comfortably use the application in low-light conditions with reduced eye strain and professional appearance.

**Why this priority**: Dark mode is a modern UX expectation. The current implementation reportedly looks unprofessional, which impacts user satisfaction and platform credibility. This should be addressed to meet contemporary design standards, though it's not blocking core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by enabling dark mode, navigating through all major pages and components, and verifying that text is readable, contrast ratios meet accessibility standards, interactive elements are clearly visible, and the overall appearance is polished and professional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user enables dark theme, **When** they navigate throughout the application, **Then** all pages display with proper dark mode colors, readable text, appropriate contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum 4.5:1), and clearly visible interactive elements
2. **Given** the dark theme is active, **When** users interact with data tables, cards, and forms, **Then** all content maintains visual hierarchy, borders are discernible, and hover states are clearly indicated
3. **Given** the dark theme displays role-based colors (Don, Mafia, Sheriff, Citizen), **When** users view player statistics and game details, **Then** role colors are adjusted for dark backgrounds while maintaining brand consistency and accessibility
4. **Given** users switch between light and dark themes, **When** the transition occurs, **Then** it happens smoothly without flickering, and all components render correctly in the new theme

### Edge Cases

- **EC-001**: When an administrator attempts to stop an import that is in a commit phase, the system MUST allow cancellation but clearly warn that the current batch (100 records) will complete before termination
- **EC-002**: When clearing the database, the system MUST preserve all User accounts (admin and regular), all sync/import audit tables, and system configuration to prevent complete lockout, while removing all imported game data including Player, Club, Game, Tournament, and related statistics
- **EC-003**: When an import is stopped mid-operation, the system MUST release all locks (advisory locks, database locks), update sync status appropriately, and ensure no orphaned transactions remain
- **EC-004**: When dark theme is enabled on pages with data visualizations (charts, graphs), the system MUST ensure chart elements (axes, legends, data points) have sufficient contrast and visibility
- **EC-005**: When clearing the database fails partway through (e.g., due to foreign key constraints or active connections), the system MUST rollback all changes, maintain data integrity, and report specific errors to administrators
- **EC-006**: When administrators clear the database while users are actively viewing data, the system MUST handle graceful degradation by showing appropriate empty states and preventing errors on affected pages
- **EC-007**: When switching themes, the system MUST preserve user scroll position and form inputs to prevent data loss or disorientation
- **EC-008**: When an import is cancelled due to timeout after clearing the database, the system MUST provide administrators with a clear path to restart the import from the beginning
