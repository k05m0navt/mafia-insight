# Tasks: Comprehensive User Flow Testing

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-comprehensive-testing/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included as this is a testing framework implementation with TDD approach.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Testing framework**: `tests/` at repository root
- **Configuration**: `tests/config/` for test configuration files
- **Utilities**: `tests/utils/` for shared testing utilities
- **Fixtures**: `tests/fixtures/` for test data

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1-US3 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1-US3 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1-US3 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1-US6 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Test utilities before test suites
- Test suites before test execution
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Test utilities within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create authentication E2E tests in tests/e2e/auth/login.spec.ts"
Task: "Create authentication E2E tests in tests/e2e/auth/signup.spec.ts"
Task: "Create authentication E2E tests in tests/e2e/auth/logout.spec.ts"
Task: "Create authentication E2E tests in tests/e2e/auth/role-based-access.spec.ts"

# Launch all test utilities for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create authentication test utilities in tests/utils/auth/AuthTestUtils.ts"
Task: "Implement authentication test scenarios in tests/utils/auth/AuthScenarios.ts"
Task: "Create authentication test data generators in tests/utils/data/auth/UserDataGenerator.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Authentication)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Analytics)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Data Import)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all P1 user stories independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Add User Story 6 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
8. Add User Story 7 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
9. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Authentication)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Analytics)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Data Import)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (API Testing)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (PWA Testing)
   - Developer F: User Story 6 (Error Handling)
   - Developer G: User Story 7 (Cross-Browser)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Total tasks: 250
- P1 tasks: 60 (US1: 20, US2: 20, US3: 20)
- P2 tasks: 80 (US4: 20, US5: 20, US6: 20, US8: 20)
- P3 tasks: 20 (US7: 20)
- Foundational tasks: 50 (comprehensive infrastructure)
- Polish tasks: 40
- Parallel opportunities: 180+ tasks can be executed in parallel
