# Implementation Plan: Comprehensive User Flow Testing

**Branch**: `007-comprehensive-testing` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-comprehensive-testing/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement comprehensive testing framework for Mafia Insight platform covering all user flows, API endpoints, backend services, error handling, and cross-platform compatibility. The testing strategy uses primarily automated testing with manual testing for complex scenarios, production-like anonymized data, and full performance profiling including memory leak detection.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, JavaScript ES2022, Node.js 18+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Playwright, Jest, Vitest, Artillery, Lighthouse, OWASP ZAP  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (test database), Redis (test cache), Local storage (PWA testing)  
**Testing**: Playwright (E2E), Jest/Vitest (Unit), Artillery (Load), Lighthouse (Performance), OWASP ZAP (Security)  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge), Mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome), PWA environments
**Project Type**: Web application testing framework  
**Performance Goals**: 1000 concurrent users, <2s API response time, 95% UI component rendering success, 90% error recovery success  
**Constraints**: 80% test automation coverage, production-like data with anonymization, comprehensive security testing, cross-browser compatibility  
**Scale/Scope**: 8 user stories, 17 functional requirements, 17 success criteria, 10+ edge cases, 4 browser types, 3 device types

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### Clean Architecture Compliance ✅

- **Test Framework Design**: Testing framework follows Clean Architecture with clear separation between test execution, data management, and reporting layers
- **Dependency Inversion**: Test utilities depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Business Logic Isolation**: Test scenarios are isolated from testing framework implementation details

### Test-Driven Development Compliance ✅

- **TDD Mandatory**: All testing framework components will be developed using TDD
- **Test Coverage**: Target 80%+ coverage for testing framework itself
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Strict adherence to TDD cycle for all testing utilities

### Spec-Driven Development Compliance ✅

- **Comprehensive Specification**: Feature spec includes 7 user stories with clear acceptance criteria
- **Independent Testability**: Each user story can be tested independently
- **Measurable Success Criteria**: 17 specific, measurable success criteria defined

### Modern Frontend Best Practices Compliance ✅

- **Component Testing**: UI components tested for accessibility and performance
- **State Management Testing**: Predictable state management testing patterns
- **Design System Compliance**: Testing ensures UI follows established design systems

### Package Management Compliance ✅

- **Yarn Usage**: All testing dependencies managed through yarn
- **Documentation**: Clear rationale for each testing tool selection
- **Context7 MCP**: Used for accessing current testing tool documentation

### Code Quality & Standards Compliance ✅

- **Linting**: All testing code will pass ESLint and Prettier checks
- **Code Reviews**: Testing framework code reviews will verify architecture compliance
- **Performance Requirements**: Clear performance benchmarks defined for testing execution

**Structure Decision**: Web application testing framework integrated with existing Next.js application structure. Testing framework organized by test type (e2e, integration, unit, performance, security) with shared utilities and fixtures. Maintains separation between testing framework and application code while enabling comprehensive coverage of all user flows and system components.
