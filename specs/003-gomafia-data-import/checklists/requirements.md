# Specification Quality Checklist: GoMafia Initial Data Import

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 25, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✓

- Specification focuses on WHAT users need (populated database, visible data, progress feedback)
- Written in user-centric language understandable to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and complete
- No framework-specific details in the spec body (Playwright/Prisma mentioned only in Dependencies, which is appropriate)

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✓

- All 18 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Success criteria include specific metrics (10 minutes for 1000 players, 98% validation rate, 5 seconds display time)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes (data visibility, progress feedback) rather than technical implementation
- Edge cases cover network failures, partial data, large datasets, cancellation, and data conflicts
- Scope is clearly defined: initial data import to populate empty database using existing sync infrastructure
- Dependencies properly list feature 002 and required infrastructure components

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✓

- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories prioritized with P1 (core import), P2 (progress visibility, validation), P3 (error recovery)
- Success criteria are measurable and verifiable without implementation knowledge
- No implementation leakage detected in specification sections

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Key Strengths:**

- Clear focus on solving the empty database problem
- Comprehensive edge case handling
- Well-prioritized user stories with independent testing strategies
- Measurable success criteria with specific targets
- Proper dependency identification (relies on feature 002 infrastructure)

**Recommendations for Planning Phase:**

- Consider breaking down FR-001 through FR-018 into smaller implementation tasks
- Plan for robust testing strategy covering edge cases EC-001 through EC-006
- Ensure monitoring and logging capabilities for import operations
