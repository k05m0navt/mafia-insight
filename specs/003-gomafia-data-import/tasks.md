# Tasks: GoMafia Initial Data Import

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-gomafia-data-import/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md (with 4 user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/import-api.yaml

**Tests**: Included (TDD mandatory per Constitution Principle II)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a **Next.js full-stack web application**. Paths use the existing structure:

- `src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages and API routes
- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/lib/` - Business logic and utilities
- `src/services/` - Service layer
- `prisma/` - Database schema and migrations
- `tests/` - All test files (unit, integration, e2e)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion (T001-T005) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion (T006-T018)
  - User Story 1 (P1, Phase 3): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (P2, Phase 4): Can start after Foundational - Integrates with US1 but independently testable
  - User Story 4 (P2, Phase 5): Can start after Foundational - Extends US1/US2 but independently testable
  - User Story 3 (P3, Phase 6): Can start after Foundational - Extends all previous stories but independently testable
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 components but can be implemented/tested independently
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1/US2 but can be implemented/tested independently
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends all stories but can be implemented/tested independently

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD mandatory)
- Validators/parsers before scrapers
- Scrapers before orchestration
- Orchestration before API endpoints
- API endpoints before UI components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

#### Phase 1 (Setup)

- T002, T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel after T001

#### Phase 2 (Foundational)

- T006-T010 (checkpoint tests + impl) can run in parallel with T011-T015 (advisory lock) and T016-T018 (rate limiter)

#### Phase 3 (User Story 1)

- T019-T022 (all validation tests) can run in parallel
- T023-T026 (all validation impls) can run in parallel
- T027-T031 (all scraper tests) can run in parallel
- T037-T040 (parser tests + impls) can run in parallel

#### Phase 4 (User Story 2)

- T070-T073 (hook tests + impls) can run in parallel
- T074-T079 (all UI component tests + impls) can run in parallel

#### Phase 5 (User Story 4)

- T086-T089 (validation infrastructure) can run in parallel
- T093-T096 (UI enhancement tests + impls) can run in parallel

#### Phase 6 (User Story 3)

- T101-T105 (retry and timeout tests + impls) can run in parallel
- T106-T109 (all error handling tests) can run in parallel
- T120-T125 (all US3 UI components) can run in parallel

#### Phase 7 (Polish)

- T132-T134 (documentation) can run in parallel
- T135-T138 (code quality) can run in parallel
- T150-T153 (deployment prep) can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Core Import)

```bash
# Launch all validation schema tests together:
Task: "Write test for Player Zod schema validation in tests/unit/validators/player-schema.test.ts"
Task: "Write test for Club Zod schema validation in tests/unit/validators/club-schema.test.ts"
Task: "Write test for Tournament Zod schema validation in tests/unit/validators/tournament-schema.test.ts"
Task: "Write test for Game Zod schema validation in tests/unit/validators/game-schema.test.ts"

# Then implement all schemas together:
Task: "Implement Player Zod schema in src/lib/gomafia/validators/player-schema.ts"
Task: "Implement Club Zod schema in src/lib/gomafia/validators/club-schema.ts"
Task: "Implement Tournament Zod schema in src/lib/gomafia/validators/tournament-schema.ts"
Task: "Implement Game Zod schema in src/lib/gomafia/validators/game-schema.ts"

# Launch all scraper tests together (after pagination handler is ready):
Task: "Write test for ClubsScraper from /rating?tab=clubs in tests/unit/scrapers/clubs-scraper.test.ts"
Task: "Write test for PlayersScraper from /rating in tests/unit/scrapers/players-scraper.test.ts"
Task: "Write test for PlayerStatsScraper with dynamic year loading from /stats/{id} in tests/unit/scrapers/player-stats-scraper.test.ts"
Task: "Write test for TournamentsScraper from /tournaments in tests/unit/scrapers/tournaments-scraper.test.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T018) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T019-T069)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Empty database ‚Üí visit /players page ‚Üí auto-trigger executes
   - Wait 3-4 hours ‚Üí verify ‚â•1000 players, ‚â•5000 games imported
   - Verify all relationships intact (GameParticipations ‚Üí Players, etc.)
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (Phase 1-2) ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Phase 3) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (**MVP!** - auto-import populates data)
3. Add User Story 2 (Phase 4) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP + progress visibility)
4. Add User Story 4 (Phase 5) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP + progress + validation)
5. Add User Story 3 (Phase 6) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Complete feature with error recovery)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 4 developers:

1. All developers complete Setup + Foundational together (Phase 1-2)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Phase 3) - Core import logic
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Phase 4) - Progress UI
   - **Developer C**: User Story 4 (Phase 5) - Validation metrics
   - **Developer D**: User Story 3 (Phase 6) - Error recovery
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team tackles Polish together (Phase 7)

**Critical Path**: User Story 1 core import (T026-T043) must complete first, then other stories can proceed in parallel.

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 154

**Tasks Per Phase**:

- Phase 1 (Setup): 5 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 13 tasks
- Phase 3 (User Story 1 - P1 MVP): 51 tasks
- Phase 4 (User Story 2 - P2): 16 tasks
- Phase 5 (User Story 4 - P2): 15 tasks
- Phase 6 (User Story 3 - P3): 31 tasks
- Phase 7 (Polish): 23 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 52 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase

**MVP Scope** (Phases 1-3): 69 tasks ‚Üí Core auto-import functionality

**Full Feature** (All Phases): 154 tasks ‚Üí Complete import with progress, validation, and error recovery

**Estimated Timeline**:

- MVP (Phases 1-3): 3-4 weeks (single developer, following TDD)
- Full Feature (All Phases): 6-10 weeks (single developer, following TDD)
- With parallel team (4 developers): 3-4 weeks for full feature

## Notes

**Format Validation**: ‚úÖ All 154 tasks follow required checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`

**Key Points**:

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- TDD: Verify tests fail before implementing (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
- Avoid: Vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

**Success Metrics**:

- All tests pass (unit + integration + e2e)
- Test coverage ‚â•80%
- Import completes within 3-4 hours for 1000 players/5000 games
- Progress updates every 2 seconds
- Validation rate ‚â•98%
- Resume capability from any checkpoint
- Advisory lock prevents concurrent imports
- 12-hour timeout enforced
