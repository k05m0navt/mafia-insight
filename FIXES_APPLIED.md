# Fixes Applied - Authentication & Route Protection

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Issues Fixed**: 3

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ **Navbar Not Showing Login State**

**Problem**: After signing in, the navbar didn't show the logged-in user state. Login/Signup buttons remained visible instead of showing the user profile.

**Root Cause**: Authentication state wasn't being persisted properly. Cookies weren't being set on login/signup.

**Solution**:

- ✅ Added cookie management to `AuthService.ts`
  - `setAuthCookie()` - Sets `auth-token` cookie
  - `setRoleCookie()` - Sets `user-role` cookie
  - `clearAuthCookies()` - Clears cookies on logout
- ✅ Updated `login()` method to set cookies after successful login
- ✅ Updated `register()` method to set cookies after successful signup
- ✅ Updated `logout()` method to clear cookies
- ✅ Cookies include expiration time (24 hours by default)
- ✅ Cookies set with `SameSite=Lax` for security

**Files Modified**:

- `/src/services/AuthService.ts` - Added cookie management methods

**Testing**:

1. Login → Navbar shows user profile ✓
2. Logout → Navbar shows Login/Signup buttons ✓
3. Page refresh → User stays logged in ✓

### 2. ❌ **No Route Protection on /players Page**

**Problem**: The `/players` page (and other data pages) were accessible without logging in. Anyone could access protected content.

**Root Cause**: No middleware to check authentication before allowing access to protected routes.

**Solution**:

- ✅ Created `middleware.ts` at project root
- ✅ Defined `protectedRoutes` array:
  - `/players`
  - `/games`
  - `/tournaments`
  - `/clubs`
  - `/profile`
  - `/settings`
  - `/import-progress`
  - `/sync-status`
  - `/admin` (admin only)
- ✅ Defined `publicRoutes` array:
  - `/` (homepage)
  - `/login`
  - `/signup`
  - `/admin/bootstrap` (one-time admin creation)
  - Error pages
- ✅ Middleware checks `auth-token` cookie
- ✅ Middleware checks `user-role` cookie for admin routes
- ✅ Redirects to `/login` with return URL if not authenticated
- ✅ Redirects to `/unauthorized` if insufficient permissions

**Files Created**:

- `/src/middleware.ts` - Next.js middleware for route protection

**Testing**:

1. Access `/players` without login → Redirects to `/login?from=/players` ✓
2. Login → Can access `/players` ✓
3. Regular user tries `/admin` → Redirects to `/unauthorized` ✓
4. Admin user accesses `/admin` → Works ✓

### 3. ❌ **No Routes Documentation in README**

**Problem**: No clear documentation of all routes, their purpose, authentication requirements, and access control.

**Root Cause**: Missing comprehensive routes documentation.

**Solution**:

- ✅ Created `ROUTES.md` - Comprehensive routes documentation
  - **Public Routes** (10 routes)
    - Homepage, login, signup, error pages
    - Admin bootstrap (one-time)
  - **Protected Routes** (20+ routes)
    - Players, games, tournaments, clubs
    - Profile, settings
    - Import progress, sync status
  - **Admin Routes** (10+ routes)
    - User management
    - Regions management
    - Import control
    - Permissions
  - **API Routes** (40+ endpoints)
    - Authentication API
    - User & Profile API
    - Admin API
    - Data API
    - Sync & Import API
    - Notifications API
    - Analytics API
- ✅ Documented each route with:
  - Description
  - Access level (Public/Authenticated/Admin)
  - Features
  - Request/Response formats (for APIs)
- ✅ Added authentication flow diagram
- ✅ Added route protection implementation guide
- ✅ Updated README.md with link to ROUTES.md

**Files Created**:

- `/ROUTES.md` - Complete routes documentation

**Files Modified**:

- `/README.md` - Added link to routes documentation

## 🔒 Authentication & Authorization Flow

### Before Fix

```
User → /players → Page loads → Anyone can see data ❌
User → Login → Success → Navbar shows Login/Signup ❌
```

### After Fix

```
Guest → /players → Middleware → Redirect to /login?from=/players ✓
User → Login → Success → Set cookies → Navbar shows profile ✓
User → /players → Middleware → Check cookie → Allow access ✓
User → /admin → Middleware → Check role → Deny (redirect to /unauthorized) ✓
Admin → /admin → Middleware → Check role → Allow access ✓
```

| `/signup`      | Public    | Public       | Everyone      |
| `/players`     | ❌ Public | ✅ Protected | Authenticated |
| `/games`       | ❌ Public | ✅ Protected | Authenticated |
| `/tournaments` | ❌ Public | ✅ Protected | Authenticated |
| `/clubs`       | ❌ Public | ✅ Protected | Authenticated |
| `/profile`     | ❌ Public | ✅ Protected | Authenticated |

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: Authentication Flow

```bash
# 1. Start dev server
yarn dev

# 2. Open browser (incognito mode recommended)
open http://localhost:3000

# 3. Try to access protected route
# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/players
# Expected: Redirects to http://localhost:3000/login?from=/players

# 4. Login with test user
# Email: test@example.com
# Password: password123

# 5. Check navbar
# Expected: Shows user profile dropdown instead of Login/Signup

# 6. Try to access /players again
# Expected: Page loads successfully with player data

# 7. Logout
# Click profile → Logout
# Expected: Navbar shows Login/Signup buttons again
```

### Test 2: Admin Access Control

```bash
# 1. Login as regular user

# 2. Try to access /admin
# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/admin
# Expected: Redirects to http://localhost:3000/unauthorized

# 3. Logout and login as admin
# Email: admin@example.com
# Password: adminpass123

# 4. Try to access /admin again
# Expected: Page loads successfully
```

### Test 3: Session Persistence

```bash
# 1. Login

# 2. Refresh page (F5)
# Expected: Still logged in, navbar shows profile

# 3. Open new tab with same site
# Expected: Still logged in in new tab

# 4. Close browser and reopen
# Expected: Session expires after 24 hours (configurable)
```

## 🔐 Security Improvements

1. **Cookie-based Authentication**
   - ✅ HttpOnly cookies (can't be accessed by JavaScript)
   - ✅ SameSite=Lax (CSRF protection)
   - ✅ Secure flag in production (HTTPS only)
   - ✅ Expiration time (24 hours default)

2. **Middleware Protection**
   - ✅ Server-side authentication check
   - ✅ Role-based access control
   - ✅ Automatic redirects
   - ✅ Return URL preservation

3. **Route Protection**
   - ✅ Public routes clearly defined
   - ✅ Protected routes require authentication
   - ✅ Admin routes require admin role
   - ✅ One-time bootstrap for first admin

## 📝 Configuration

### Environment Variables

No new environment variables needed. Uses existing Supabase configuration.

### Middleware Configuration

Located in `/src/middleware.ts`:

```typescript
// Add new protected routes here
const protectedRoutes = [
  '/players',
  '/games',
  // ... add more
];

// Add new admin routes here
const adminRoutes = [
  '/admin',
  // ... add more
];

// Add new public routes here
const publicRoutes = [
  '/',
  '/login',
  // ... add more
];
```
