## 🎯 **Solution: Use Correct Admin Email**

### Option 1: Login with Existing Admin (Recommended)

You need to login with the email that's actually in the database:

```
Email: kmnavt@gmail.com
Password: (your actual password for this account)
```

**Note**: I don't have access to this account's password. You need to use the password you set when you created this admin account.

---

### Option 2: Update Database to Use Your Preferred Email

If you want to use `k05m0navt@icloud.com` instead, I can update the database:

```sql
UPDATE users
SET email = 'k05m0navt@icloud.com'
WHERE email = 'kmnavt@gmail.com';
```

Would you like me to do this?

---

### Option 3: Create New Admin with Your Email

Delete the existing admin and create a new one:

1. Delete existing admin:

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM users WHERE email = 'kmnavt@gmail.com';
   ```

2. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/admin/bootstrap`

3. Create new admin with:
   - Email: k05m0navt@icloud.com
   - Password: 8JovshEbV6DH@FjL&c%n
